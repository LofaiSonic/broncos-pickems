1344	599234	4035661?lang=en&region=us	23	Julian Blackmon	S	Active	Blackmon and the Saints agreed on a one-year contract Wednesday, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.	Blackmon will officially head to New Orleans, helping fill the void in the team's secondary after Tyrann Mathieu retired Tuesday. Blackmon appears to have fully recovered from his offseason shoulder surgery, and he'll now compete with Jonas Sanker and J.T. Gray for the team's starting free safety role. The 26-year-old has recorded 174 combined tackles over the last two years, and he'll look to maintain that level of production with the Saints.

1345	599177	4360689?lang=en&region=us	23	Tyler Shough	QB	Active	Shough will take first-team reps Thursday, after Spencer Rattler worked with the starters Wednesday for the first practice of minicamp, Jeff Nowak of WWLAM reports.	Rattler made six starts last season as a rookie fifth-round pick, although that might not help his case much under a new coaching staff considering he completed just 57 percent of his passes and lost all six games. Shough now comes in as a rookie second-round pick -- albeit one who will turn 26 in September -- to compete for the starting job that opened up when Derek Carr announced his retirement in May. Shough recently signed a fully guaranteed rookie contract, paving the way for normal participation in training camp after he was unsigned for the offseason program.

1346	599175	4426339?lang=en&region=us	23	Spencer Rattler	QB	Active	Rattler got most of the first-team reps Wednesday on the first day of training camp, but rookie Tyler Shough is scheduled to work with the starters Thursday, WWLAM's Jeff Nowak reports.	In other words, the Saints will treat their QB job battle as a 50-50 competition, although Shough likely has the tiebreaker given his earlier draft status (second round) and Rattler's poor numbers last season. Taken in the fifth round last spring, Rattler ended up making six starts (all losses) and completing 57.0 percent of passes for 5.8 yards per attempt, with four touchdowns and five interceptions. He played better Week 18 at Tampa Bay, but Shough nonetheless seems like at least a slight favorite for the Week 1 start under a new coaching staff.

1347	599096	4361370?lang=en&region=us	23	Chris Olave	WR	Active	Olave (concussion) has no restrictions to begin training camp and will be a full participant, Erin Summers of the Saints' official website reports.	Olave participated in the offseason program, so this was the expected news entering training camp. Nonetheless, it's noteworthy considering Olave's history of concussions. Olave was able to play in just eight regular-season games last season, and he's now going to be catching passes from someone other than Derek Carr in 2025. The Saints are holding a three-man quarterback competition this summer, with the candidates being second-round rookie Tyler Shough, 2024 fifth-rounder Spencer Rattler and 2023 fourth-round pick Jake Haener.

Hill suffered a torn ACL in his left knee in Week 13 last season and is still working his way back from the injury. It's unclear at this point if the 34-year-old will be ready in time for Week 1. With a new coaching staff in New Orleans, it also remains to be seen what kind of role Hill will play in coach Kellen Moore's offense this upcoming season.

Green spent the last two seasons competing in the UFL with the Arlington Renegades, and he now has an opportunity to continue his development at the NFL level. He previously spent the 2022 season on the Cowboys' practice squad.	Unknown	Unknown	Not Specified	Not Specified	\N	\N	2025-06-18 20:51:00	A	2025-07-24 16:00:53.190725	2025-07-24 16:00:53.190725
1351	598790	4240021?lang=en&region=us	23	Cam Akers	RB	Active	The Saints signed Akers to a contract Friday, Dianna Russini of The Athletic reports.	In his fifth NFL campaign in 2024, Akers split time between the Texans and Vikings, recording 104 carries for 444 yards (4.3 YPC) and two touchdowns and 14 catches (on 18 targets) for 68 yards and three more TDs. He entered the offseason as an unrestricted free agent and went without much interest until New Orleans' mandatory minicamp this week, when he worked out for the team. Akers showed enough to earn another opportunity, but he joins a crowded backfield behind No. 1 option Alvin Kamara along with Kendre Miller and rookie sixth-rounder Devin Neal.

1352	598718	3054850?lang=en&region=us	23	Alvin Kamara	RB	Active	Kamara (groin) participated in Tuesday's minicamp practice.	Kamara, who missed the last three games of the 2024 regular season with a groin injury, hadn't been participating in the Saints' voluntary workouts this offseason, but his activity during Tuesday's mandatory minicamp session demonstrates that he's moved past the issue. While there's no doubt that Kamara slots in as the team's No. 1 back, it remains to be seen how the rest of the backfield depth chart will shake out prior to Week 1. For now, the top candidates for complementary work behind Kamara (who recorded 228 carries and 68 catches in 14 contests last year) are Kendre Miller, Devin Neal and Clyde Edwards-Helaire.

McCoy ended last year on IR after injuring his elbow against Green Bay in Week 16. The veteran out of Texas A&amp;M is now healthy again and is expected to serve as the Saints' starting center in 2025.

1354	598638	4428350?lang=en&region=us	23	Quincy Riley	CB	Active	Riley (undisclosed) is participating in OTAs.	The cornerback and fourth-round pick in the 2025 draft missed a rookie minicamp session in May because he was recovering from offseason surgery. Saints coach Kellen Moore did not reveal the specific injury, though he did say it was unrelated to the ankle issue from Riley's college career at Louisville. The rookie might have a chance to compete with Ugo Amadi for New Orleans' slot corner role in 2025.

1355	598529	4696043?lang=en&region=us	23	Rejzohn Wright	CB	Active	Wright (undisclosed) has been participating in the Saints' OTAs this week, Luke Johnson of NOLA.com reports.	The 24-year-old spent the 2024 season on the Saints' injured-reserve list after being hurt during the preseason. He's yet to appear in a regular-season NFL game.

1356	598510	4032473?lang=en&region=us	23	Rashid Shaheed	WR	Active	Shaheed (knee) is participating in OTAs without any apparent restrictions and joined Chris Olave (concussion) in punt-return drills Thursday, Luke Johnson of NOLA.com reports.	Shaheed and Olave have both looked fully healthy at OTAs, per Matthew Paras of NOLA.com, an encouraging development as the Saints work through a three-way quarterback competition to recover from the offseason retirement of Derek Carr (shoulder). Rookie second-round pick Tyler Shough, 2024 fifth-rounder Spencer Rattler and third-year pro Jake Haener (oblique) all appear to have a legitimate shot at securing the starting gig for Week 1. With Haener sidelined multiple weeks, and potentially until training camp, Shaheed's current focus will be to build chemistry with Shough and Rattler. His full participation level aligns with the four-to-six-month recovery timetable attached to the season-ending meniscus injury Shaheed suffered last October.

1357	598509	4599739?lang=en&region=us	23	Kendre Miller	RB	Active	Miller (concussion) participated in voluntary OTAs on Thursday, while starter Alvin Kamara (groin) was not in attendance, Luke Johnson of NOLA.com reports.	Miller missed New Orleans' regular-season finale due to a concussion in 2024, after a pair of hamstring injuries had forced him to miss all but two of the team's first 12 games; however, he's now fully healthy. Miller will turn only 23 in June, so he still has an opportunity to secure the No. 2 role behind Kamara, a three-down workhorse who is entering his age 30-season. Clyde Edwards-Helaire and rookie sixth-rounder Devin Neal represent Miller's top competition for backup reps. Head coach Kellen Moore said he views this offseason as "a blank slate" for Miller, per John Sigler of USA Today, but the reality is that the 2023 third-round pick is likely running out of chances to prove he can stay healthy. Injuries have limited Miller to just 14 regular-season appearances (out of 34 possible games) since entering the league, and he's mustered 80 carries for 304 yards (3.8 YPC) and two scores in that span.

1358	598405	4243322?lang=en&region=us	23	Jake Haener	QB	Questionable	Haener sustained an oblique strain at practice Wednesday that is expected to sideline him multiple weeks but leave him ready for the start of training camp in late July, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.	A 2023 fourth-round pick who suited up for eight games last season, Haener boasts the longest tenure in the NFL of the Saints' quarterback room. With his participation in the team's three-way contest for the Week 1 starting job now on pause until potentially as long as training camp, increased reps are up for grabs for rookie second-rounder Tyler Shough and 2024 fifth-round pick Spencer Rattler throughout OTAs. Hunter Dekkers, an undrafted free agent who started for Iowa State in 2022 before playing in junior college in 2024, also could push for some opportunities at OTAs with Haener unavailable.

1359	599288	4595348?lang=en&region=us	24	Malik Nabers	WR	Active	Giants coach Brian Daboll suggested Thursday that Nabers' toe could require continued management even though the wideout is practicing at the start of training camp, Pat Leonard of the New York Daily News reports.	Nabers said Wednesday that his toe feels good at the moment but might end up requiring surgery at some point in his career. It's an issue that dates back to college, and while it popped up again toward the end of his rookie season, Nabers nonetheless had 235 receiving yards and three TDs over the final two weeks, making his case as a first-round fantasy pick for 2025. He's mostly going in the second half of the first round now, with ADP reflecting minimal concern (if any) about the toe injury that held him out of spring practices.

1360	599282	4426542?lang=en&region=us	24	Darius Alexander	DT	Active	Alexander practiced at full capacity Wednesday, Dan Salomone of the Giants' official site reports.	Alexander was selected in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft but was sidelined during OTAs with an undisclosed injury. Positively, he's back on the field for the start of his first training camp, and he should be in line for a significant role along the Giants' defensive line to begin his pro career.

1361	599174	4259566?lang=en&region=us	24	Andrew Thomas	OT	Out	Thomas, who is on the active/PUP list due to a foot injury, is expected to be active for the regular-season opener, Paul Schwartz of the New York Post reports.	Thomas was placed on the active/PUP list Tuesday as he continues to heal from a Lisfranc injury that ended his 2024 season in Week 6. He underwent surgery for the injury in October and has not participated in offseason programs since the injury, but the designation does allow for Thomas to return to the practice field and preseason contests at any point should the team deem him ready, with the expectation that the 2020 first-round pick will be ready for Week 1 in September.

1014	599245	3117922?lang=en&region=us	1	Bilal Nichols	DT	Out	Nichols (neck) was placed on the active/PUP list Wednesday, Zach Gershman of the Cardinals' official site reports.	Nichols had his 2024 season cut short by a stinger, but he was able to practice in OTAs heading into training camp. It's unclear if he's suffered a setback, but regardless, he won't begin camp on the practice field.

Ojulari tore his ACL in training camp one year ago. He was reportedly close to returning to the practice field during offseason practices, so his stay on the PUP list will presumably be short.

1362	599164	14881?lang=en&region=us	24	Russell Wilson	QB	Active	Giants coach Brian Daboll confirmed Wednesday that Wilson is the team's starting quarterback, Paul Schwartz of the New York Post reports.	Wilson, 36, took first-team reps throughout the offseason program and will continue to do so in training camp. Daboll's comments Wednesday suggest Jameis Winston and first-round pick Jaxson Dart are competing for the No. 2 QB spot rather than making any push for Wilson's place atop the depth chart. There's nonetheless a decent chance that Dart and/or Winston makes starts at some point this year, in part because the Giants aren't expected to field a strong team. They'll play six of their first eight games against 2024 playoff participants, including Week 1 at Washington and Weeks 6 and 8 against the Eagles.

1363	599137	4240464?lang=en&region=us	24	Victor Dimukeje	LB	Out	The Giants placed Dimukeje (pectoral) on the active/non-football injury list Tuesday,  Dan Salomone of the team's official site reports.	Dimukeje tore his pec during offseason workouts and isn't yet ready to practice. The 25-year-old signed a contract with the Giants in March following four seasons in Arizona. While Dimukeje can be activated from the NFI list at any time during the preseason, it's not clear how long he'll be sidelined.

1364	599136	4570561?lang=en&region=us	24	Eric Gray	RB	Out	The Giants placed Gray (undisclosed) on the active/PUP list Tuesday, Dan Salomone of the team's official site reports.	It's not clear what issue has caused Gray to not be ready for the start of training camp, but it will be important for him to get back on the field quickly since he's not a lock for a roster spot. Gray can be activated from the PUP list and begin practicing as soon as he passes a physical.

1365	599094	4040761?lang=en&region=us	24	Devin Singletary	RB	Active	Singletary is likely to remain on the Giants' roster despite Tyrone Tracy's role as the likely primary ball carrier and the addition of RB Cam Skattebo via the 2025 NFL Draft, Art Stapleton of The Bergen Record reports.	Tracy and Skattebo provide promise as a young and talented one-two punch, which could lead to Singletary taking on a reduced role in New York's offense. However, Stapleton notes that Singletary is likely a lock for the roster, both because his veteran presence is valued on and off the field and -- perhaps more importantly -- because the Giants wouldn't gain any cap savings if they were to release the veteran RB. After signing a three-year, $16.5 million contract with New York in March of 2024, Singletary ceded lead ball-carrying duties to Tracy over the course of last year and averaged just 3.9 YPC over 113 rushes across 15 contests, adding 21 receptions on 24 targets for 119 yards.

1366	599083	4035463?lang=en&region=us	24	K'Von Wallace	S	Active	The Giants signed Wallace (ankle) on Tuesday.	The 27-year-old safety spent last season in Seattle and appeared in nine regular-season games before his season was cut short in Week 9 due to an ankle injury that required a trip to injured reserve. Now healthy, Wallace will go compete for a third or fourth safety spot in New York behind Jevon Holland and Tyler Nubin.

1367	598886	4569587?lang=en&region=us	24	Wan'Dale Robinson	WR	Active	Robinson has indicated during the offseason that he wants more looks downfield during the upcoming campaign after playing mostly in the slot last season, Dan Duggan of The Athletic reports.	Robinson got plenty of volume last year with 93 catches on 140 targets, but he averaged just 7.5 yards per catch, the lowest mark among NFL wide receivers. The Kentucky product has expressed his desire to line up outside more often, but the likelihood of that happening is complicated by the presence of Malik Nabers and Darius Slayton as deep threats in the Giants' offense. Duggan notes that Robinson was mostly used in a short-yardage capacity during minicamp this spring even with Nabers not participating, so his wishes may not lead to any changes. That said, it's at least worth noting that New York will be more equipped to throw the ball downfield than in previous campaigns with Russell Wilson, Jameis Winston and Jaxson Dart now making up the team's QB room.

1368	598864	4429148?lang=en&region=us	24	Theo Johnson	TE	Active	Johnson said he wants to play in all 17 of the Giants' regular-season games during the upcoming season, Bobby Kownack of NFL.com reports. "I've been taking my recovery and my health, what I'm putting in my body and everything, more serious than I ever have. I think that's the biggest goal for me is prioritizing my health and wellness and making sure that I'm available and consistent throughout 17 games," the tight end stated.	Johnson missed New York's final five contests last year due to a foot injury, but he is back to full health and has participated in the team's OTAs this offseason. Though he got off to somewhat of a rocky start as a rookie, Johnson had been coming on strong prior to getting hurt, averaging 3.6 catches for 43.2 yards over his final five contests. He'll look to build upon that production as the Giants' top tight end in 2025, and there is potential for more opportunities now that Johnson is working with a revamped QB room that features Russell Wilson, Jameis Winston and promising rookie Jaxson Dart.

Hyatt had his left leg stretched by a trainer after exiting a practice drill early. The 2023 third-round pick has gotten extra first-team reps with new quarterback Russell Wilson to start minicamp, as Malik Nabers (toe) is still limited, but he'll need to stay healthy to continue benefitting from the opportunity. Across 33 career NFL regular-season games, Hyatt has 31 catches for 435 yards and zero touchdowns on 59 targets.

Wilson is the clear starter, having taken all but a few first-team reps thus far, while Dart and Winston have been splitting second-team opportunities. Dart has shown impressive touch on his throws, but the rookie 25th overall pick is likely to begin his career in a backup role. The Giants could turn to Dart if they fall out of contention or Wilson struggles, and the team's difficult early schedule raises the likelihood of those scenarios.

1371	598649	4725996?lang=en&region=us	24	Abdul Carter	LB	Active	Carter has been used in various roles during OTAs as the Giants try to balance his playing time with Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux, Dan Duggan of The Athletic reports.	Burns and Thibodeaux are the nominal starters at outside linebacker, but the Giants deployed numerous packages featuring all three pass rushers, including some sets in which Carter shifted inside. The third overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft also got some reps with the second-team defense, including one on which Carter sacked Jameis Winston.

McFadden missed the final two games of the 2024 season, but the starting linebacker has returned to full health to begin offseason team activities. In addition to featuring in the base defense, McFadden was part of the Giants' dime package in practice. He has exceeded 100 tackles in each of the past two seasons.

Layne hurt his knee in Week 16 of last season and finished the campaign on IR. However, Schmeelk reports that the 25-year-old safety "made a couple good plays" during practice Friday, so it appears Layne is back to full health. He'll have a chance to compete for a depth role in the defensive backfield during training camp.

1374	599291	4362887?lang=en&region=us	25	Justin Fields	QB	Questionable	Fields was diagnosed with a dislocated toe after exiting Thursday's practice, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports.	Fields left the field on a cart and was said to be limping some. He reportedly avoided a fracture, but he's still undergoing further testing to analyze the full severity of his injury. For now, we know that it's a dislocated toe -- and not the big toe -- on his right foot. Tyrod Taylor figures to temporarily take over as the first-team quarterback, at least for the next few practices.

Smith was placed on the NFI list due to an undisclosed issue, but he has been cleared to practice after passing his physical. His return is timely for the undrafted free agent out of South Carolina State, who will audition for a spot on the Jets' 53-man roster during training camp and preseason games.

1376	599228	4613104?lang=en&region=us	25	Malachi Corley	WR	Active	Corley (undisclosed) participated in Wednesday's practice, Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic reports.	Corley missed most of OTAs and minicamp due to an undisclosed injury. He was cleared to return to practice Wednesday but struggled during 11-on-11 drills, and the 2024 third-rounder will have to make the most of his reps during training camp to earn a spot on the Jets' 53-man roster for the 2025 campaign. Corley played just 80 offensive snaps across nine regular-season games last year, posting three catches (on six targets) for 16 yards while rushing for 26 yards on two carries.

1377	599208	4685247?lang=en&region=us	25	Braelon Allen	RB	Active	Allen looked explosive on the first day of training camp Wednesday, Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic reports, and Rosenblatt expects Allen to play a larger role in the running back's second NFL season.	Allen came out of the gate hot in his rookie season but averaged only 3.1 yards per carry from Week 5 onward. The 2024 fourth-round pick out of Wisconsin was the youngest player in the NFL at the start of last season and won't turn 22 years old until Jan. 20, so some growing pains were to be expected. If he can successfully run with power behind his 6-foot-1, 235-pound frame, Allen could effectively complement shifty lead back Breece Hall, though 2024 fifth-round draft pick Isaiah Davis is also trying to carve out a role in a Jets backfield that's unchanged from 2024 in terms of personnel.

1378	598994	3929636?lang=en&region=us	25	Irvin Charles	WR	Out	Charles (knee) was placed on the active/PUP list by the Jets on Saturday.	The wide receiver and special teamer tore his ACL in Week 14 of the 2024 campaign and ended the season on injured reserve. It remains unclear if he'll be ready for the start of the 2025 campaign, though he can return from the PUP list once he's ready to practice. Charles has played on more than 200 special-teams snaps in each of his two seasons with the Jets.

1379	598993	4567962?lang=en&region=us	25	Jermaine Johnson	LB	Out	Johnson (Achilles) was put on the active/PUP list by the Jets on Saturday.	This move was expected, as Johnson tore his Achilles in Week 2 of the 2024 campaign and still had not returned by OTAs in May and June. At the same time, Jets coach Aaron Glenn said in June that Johnson should be ready for the start of the regular season, per Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic.  Two years ago, the defensive end recorded 55 tackles (36 solo), including 7.5 sacks, and seven pass breakups.

Taylor's four-year, $10.5 million contract includes $9.6 million in guaranteed money. The Jets now have all their draft picks under contract, one day before rookies are set to report to training camp. Taylor, whom the Jets drafted 42nd overall in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft, will compete for the starting tight-end role against Jeremy Ruckert and Stone Smartt, who have one regular-season NFL touchdown between them.

1381	598906	4427250?lang=en&region=us	25	Sauce Gardner	CB	Active	The Jets and Gardner agreed to terms on a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension Tuesday, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports.	In back-to-back days, the Jets have locked in two of their first-round picks from the 2022 Draft after Garrett Wilson agreed to a four-year extension Monday. This deal for Gardner includes $85.653 million guaranteed, per Adam Schefter of ESPN, and also makes him the highest-paid cornerback in the NFL in terms of average annual value. Through his first three pro seasons, Gardner has been a first-team All-Pro two times, though he does have only three interceptions among 41 pass defenses in 48 regular-season appearances. He'll continue to serve as a shut-down corner in New York's defense.	Unknown	Unknown	Not Specified	Not Specified	\N	\N	2025-07-15 18:47:00	A	2025-07-24 16:01:09.325859	2025-07-24 16:01:09.325859
1382	598890	4569618?lang=en&region=us	25	Garrett Wilson	WR	Active	The Jets signed Wilson to a four-year, $130 million contract extension Monday, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.	The deal contains $90 million guaranteed and locks Wilson up with the Jets through the 2030 season. New York had two more seasons of contractual control with Wilson, but the sides are getting the long-term deal out of the way early. Wilson turns 25 years old next week and has produced three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons since the Jets used the No. 10 overall pick on the wideout out of Ohio State in the 2022 Draft. Wilson set career bests across the board last season with his 101-1,104-7 receiving line and again looks to be the unquestioned alpha WR1 with the Jets following the release of Davante Adams earlier in the offseason.

1383	598813	4574716?lang=en&region=us	25	Harrison Mevis	PK	Active	The Jets signed Mevis to a contract Tuesday, Rich Cimini of ESPN.com reports.	Mevis spent time with Carolina in 2024 after going undrafted out of Missouri, but he wasn't able to stick on the Panthers' regular-season roster. He resurfaced with the Birmingham Stallions of the UFL for their 2025 season, converting 20 of 21 field-goal attempts. Mevis now joins a kicker competition that includes Caden Davis and Anders Carlson, with the latter being the favorite to win the starting job ahead of Week 1.

1384	598785	3115306?lang=en&region=us	25	Josh Reynolds	WR	Active	Reynolds showcased impressive chemistry with quarterback Justin Fields at mandatory minicamp and is the early favorite to secure the No. 2 receiver role behind Garrett Wilson, Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic reports.	Reynolds' early rapport with Fields and willingness to contribute as a blocker in the run game have made a good impression on head coach Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand, currently giving him an advantage over Allen Lazard for the top receiver gig behind Wilson. Of course, Glenn and Engstrand seem likely to import something similar to the run-heavy approach deployed during their time together in Detroit, which would be suited to Fields' skill set. That may leave few targets left up for grabs for wideouts other than Wilson, especially with Breece Hall's presence as a capable pass catcher out of the backfield and the addition of rookie second-round TE Mason Taylor. In deeper fantasy formats, locking up the No. 2 role will at least give Reynolds a realistic path to having spike weeks in 2025.

1385	598783	4427366?lang=en&region=us	25	Breece Hall	RB	Active	Hall said at mandatory minicamp Wednesday he's motivated "to go prove that I am 'The Guy'" to a new regime led by new head coach Aaron Glenn, Al Iannazzone of Newsday reports.	Glenn talked up using all of Hall, Braelon Allen and Isaiah Davis "as much as possible" earlier this offseason, but Hall is committed to securing another workhorse role for 2025. "We have a great running back room," Hall said, "but my mentality is every day I'm going to prove that I am the best back on this roster and one of the best backs in the league." He also revealed that despite suiting up for 16 regular-season games in 2024, the knee injury he dealt with was more serious than previously disclosed. "If I could go back, I probably would have taken more time off," the 24-year-old said. If Hall's production dip in 2024 can indeed be explained away by injury and the Jets' overall struggles on offense, his three-down ability and talent level will put him in solid position to bounce back to elite levels in 2025. Glenn and new offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand are both acquainted with Detroit's run-heavy, two-back approach, but in New York it's possible QB Justin Fields could mix in alongside Hall more than other tailbacks.

1386	598772	4240456?lang=en&region=us	25	Michael Carter II	CB	Active	Carter "said he's completely healthy" again after dealing with a back injury during the 2024 season, Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic reports.	The cornerback didn't fully heal from the injury until February, per Rosenblatt. Carter had a disappointing 2024 after signing a three-year, $30.75 million extension before the season started, missing four games due to injury, playing far fewer snaps than he did in 2023 (647 to 263), starting five fewer contests (six to one) and setting career lows in tackles (24) and pass breakups (one). This year, the 2021 fifth-round pick will try to return to the form of his first few seasons, when he recorded at least 50 tackles and five pass breakups in each campaign.

Fashanu's rookie 2024 season ended early due to a foot injury he suffered in Week 16. The issue didn't require surgery, and Fashanu appears to be back to full health as he prepares for a likely starting role at left tackle in the upcoming campaign.

Barnes sat out the entire 2024 campaign due to an ankle injury that landed him on injured reserve, but the 2023 sixth-round draft pick has recovered ahead of the 2025 campaign. Barnes appeared in four games as a rookie but played exclusively on special teams. He'll compete for a roster spot with the Jets in training camp.

1389	599299	4602197?lang=en&region=us	26	Andrew Mukuba	S	Active	Mukuba was seeing first-team reps at safety Thursday, Brandon Lee Gowton of Bleeding Green Nation reports.	The 2025 second-round pick appears to be in a prime position to play meaningful snaps early in his career earning first-team reps in Philly's nickel defense. With Cooper DeJean reportedly moving all over the secondary, it will be interesting to see how Mukuba, who led the SEC in interceptions with five last year, continues to fit in the defensive plans.

Jurgens is still recovering from back surgery he underwent in February but is getting closer to being at full health.

Green is hurt once again after having been limited to just 12 regular-season games last season due to a shoulder injury. The 24-year-old was traded to the Eagles from the Texans back in March and will back up Landon Dickerson (knee) at left guard once he's healthy.

The injury doesn't appear to be serious, as Carter has not been placed on the active/PUP list, but he could be held out of practices and preseason games to avoid aggravating his shoulder. Carter saw a significant increase in his snap count during his sophomore NFL campaign, and the 2023 first-rounder is expected to take on an even greater role on the Eagles' defensive front in the upcoming season.

The Eagles have a new offensive coordinator, Kevin Patullo, who replaces Kellen Moore after spending the last four years as Nick Sirianni's passing-game coordinator. Continuity is the theme otherwise, with Philadelphia returning all but one of last year's starters on offense (G Mekhi Becton) after winning the Super Bowl. Two of the starting linemen are working back from offseason surgeries, but it seems all the key skill-position players are healthy for the start of training camp, including Hurts, Saquon Barkley and A.J. Brown. With 52 rushing touchdowns in 62 regular-season starts over the past four years, Hurts has become one of the most reliable assets at any position for fantasy, even though his passing volume and efficiency have fluctuated considerably from year to year.

That's the ideal scenario for IDP value, with DeJean playing safety in the base defense and slot corner in nickel packages. The other options are to play him as an outside cornerback in the base defense -- opposite Quinyon Mitchell -- or to take DeJean off the field and only use him as a nickel. An every-down role with snaps at both safety and slot corner could help make DeJean an IDP star.

Nolen will be able to return to practice and participate in preseason games whenever he's ready. However, head coach Jonathan Gannon relayed Wednesday that the rookie first-rounder is expected to miss "some time," and the injury could keep Nolen out for the start of the regular season, per Josh Weinfuss of ESPN.com. Nolen's absence opens the door for PJ Mustipher and Elijah Simmons to see more reps at defensive tackle during training camp.

It probably doesn't mean much on the first day of training camp, with the Eagles initially deferring to Dillon's experience (597 carries in 60 regular-season games) over Shipley's familiarity (he was the team's third-string RB last year). Dillon seems to be back at full health after a neck injury last August ended his fifth season with the Packers before it even got started. He signed a one-year contract in Philadelphia this spring, getting less than $200,000 guaranteed but with a chance to replace Kenneth Gainwell (who is now with the Steelers) as the team's No. 2 RB. While Shipley is a recent fourth-round pick and surely more nimble, Dillon's 240-plus-pound frame could have some value to the Eagles if Saquon Barkley were to miss time.

Campbell fell to the end of the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft due in part to concerns regarding a labrum issue that ultimately required surgery in March. However, he appears to be ahead of the team's original injury timeline, as he wasn't expected to start participating in the Eagles' offseason practices until August.

1397	599187	4426340?lang=en&region=us	26	Nakobe Dean	LB	Out	Dean (knee) was placed on the active/PUP list Wednesday, Jimmy Kempski of Philly Voice reports.	Heading into his fourth NFL season, Dean is still recovering from the torn patellar tendon he suffered during Philadelphia's first-round playoff game against the Packers and is the only Eagle to start training camp on the active/PUP list. The 24-year-old had by far his most productive year last season, totaling 128 tackles and 3.0 sacks. However, first-round pick Jihaad Campbell (shoulder) was active and practicing in limited fashion during the first day of training camp, recovering more quickly than expected from a torn labrum he had surgery for in March. With the starting linebackers undetermined, this news could give Campbell some helpful reps early as Dean watches from the sideline.

He initially signed a three-year deal with Cleveland ahead of the 2023 season and appeared in 30 regular-season games for the team across his two campaigns, registering 54 tackles (37 solo), including 7.5 sacks, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. Okoronkwo gives the Eagles some more depth off the edge.	Unknown	Unknown	Not Specified	Not Specified	\N	\N	2025-07-22 21:23:00	A	2025-07-24 16:01:17.817112	2025-07-24 16:01:17.817112

Ringo also played with the starters during training camp about a year ago before eventually taking a back seat to then-rookies Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. Ringo has also reportedly been rotating at right corner with offseason acquisition Adoree' Jackson. There's no guarantee of an every-down role for Ringo in 2025, promising as early reports out of minicamp might be.

Robinson didn't take long to latch on with a new team after being waived by the Jaguars on Thursday. The 2024 fifth-round draft pick will compete for a spot on the Eagles' roster in camp, with Robinson's best chance of sticking around coming via his ability on special teams, where he can contribute as a kick returner and gunner.

Smith suffered a torn triceps in the Eagles' Super Bowl win over Kansas City. The 2023 first-rounder had a breakout second NFL season, recording 42 tackles (21 solo) including 6.5 sacks, two fumble recoveries and one forced fumble across 16 regular-season contests. He then tallied 4.0 additional sacks during the playoffs. Smith is expected to serve as Philly's top edge rusher following the departures of Josh Sweat and Bryce Huff.

Offseason trade rumors never materialized, keeping the 30-year-old with the only NFL team he's known. Goedert averaged between 3.7 and 4.6 catches per game each of the past six regular seasons, reliably putting up solid efficiency stats on 5-to-6 targets per game, with the biggest difference from year to year being his number of absences. He's missed multiple games in five straight seasons, including a career-high seven last year before bouncing back in the playoffs with a 17-215-1 receiving line in four games. Goedert should continue to provide low-end TE1 fantasy production when healthy, serving as Philadelphia's No. 3 receiving option behind WRs A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.

Jackson was a tryout participant at Eagles minicamp and had a strong enough showing to earn a contract, per Andrew DiCecco of InsideTheBirds.com. The 5-foot-9 wideout played the final three-plus seasons of his college career at Washington and had a breakthrough senior year, catching 85 passes for 893 yards and seven touchdowns. Jackson will have an opportunity to compete for a depth role in an Eagles wideout corps that is dominated by A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.

Johnson was the 47th overall pick in the 2025 Draft back in April. He dealt with a hamstring injury during offseason workouts but is expected to be fine for the start of training camp.

Watt's deal includes $108 million guaranteed, and his $41 million average salary makes the 30-year-old edge rusher the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Watt has recorded 108 sacks in 121 career regular-season appearances with the Steelers. With his contract dispute resolved, Watt is expected to report when the Steelers open training camp July 23.

The Steelers reworked their wideout room over the offseason, jettisoning George Pickens in a trade while also letting Van Jefferson walk in free agency. DK Metcalf was acquired from Seattle, and Pittsburgh also signed 33-year-old Robert Woods. However, it sounds like Austin has a significant lead on Woods and second-year WR Roman Wilson for the starting gig opposite Metcalf. Austin had a breakout 2024 campaign, posting a 36-548-4 receiving line on 58 targets while playing in all 17 regular-season games, averaging a robust 15.2 yards per catch. Following the Steelers' acquisition of Jonnu Smith, this looks like an offense that is going to feature two tight ends in Smith and Pat Freiermuth, as opposed to three wide receivers, so the winner of the WR2 job stands to see far more playing time than the Steelers' third and fourth receivers.

Coming off an 88-catch breakout campaign while playing in all 17 regular-season games, Smith represents a threat to Freiermuth's playing time in 11 personnel even if they can work together symbiotically in multi-TE formations. Freiermuth is entering the first season of a four-year, $48.4 million contract extension, while Smith just signed a one-year, $12 million extension through 2026. Both tight ends will find it difficult to approach their 2024 volume, competing against each other (and WR DK Metcalf) for targets from a 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers in Arthur Smith's run-first offense.

Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith are headed to Pittsburgh in exchange for safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, with Day 3 picks going in both directions. The 2-for-1 trade allows Miami to shed salary without totally punting, while Pittsburgh now has standout strengths at cornerback and tight end. Ramsey may end up in an IDP-friendly role as a slot guardian and/or safety, considering the Steelers seemingly have a solid pair of boundary corners in Joey Porter and Darius Slay. They also have slot corner Beanie Bishop returning, so there's no shortage of options for nickel packages.

Smith was said to be unhappy with his contract in Miami following last year's career highs for catches, yards and touchdowns. A move to Pittsburgh reunites him with Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, who was the head coach in Atlanta when Jonnu Smith played there. It isn't an especially promising move for Smith's fantasy value, as the Steelers likely will run the ball a lot and already have Pat Freiermuth at tight end.

It was initially reported by Tom Pelissero of NFL Network mid-June that Elliott and Pittsburgh had agreed to terms on a two-year, $12.5 million extension, but the safety's new deal is officially a three-year contract instead. In any case, Elliott is now positioned to remain with the Steelers long term rather than have his contract expire after the 2025 season. He tallied a career-high 108 tackles (72 solo), six pass breakups (including one interception), two forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries across 15 regular-season games in 2024.

"I'm pretty sure this is my last season and that's why we did the one-year deal," Rodgers said, referring to the contract he inked with Pittsburgh in early June. The deal includes $10 million in guaranteed money and carries a maximum value of $19.5 million, with no cap hit lingering beyond the 2025 campaign. Rodgers, who turns 42 in December, said there's "no better way" to finish his career than with the Steelers, a team that earned a 10-7 record and a playoff berth last season with a combination of Russell Wilson and Justin Fields under center. With improved quarterback play from Rodgers and DK Metcalf as the new No. 1 wideout, Pittsburgh appears well-positioned to make some noise in the AFC North.

All tore the ACL in his right knee in Week 9 last season and spent the remainder of the campaign on IR.

Turner's first professional practice came to a rough end as he suffered an ankle injury. One of three Bears second-round picks from this year, Turner had 24 tackles for loss over his college career and will look to play a rotational role in the defensive tackle room behind starters Grady Jarrett and Gervon Dexter.

Burden's soft-tissue injury from the offseason program lingered longer than the Bears expected, but they apparently remain optimistic he'll be available for the start of training camp.

Bagent worked with the third-string skill players during Wednesday's practice, but Cronin relays that the third-year quarterback will likely swap with Keenum and serve as the QB2 on Thursday.

Johnson was placed on the active/non-football injury list this past weekend and figures to miss a good chunk of training camp after he was injured while working out away from the team. It sounds like he could miss most of the preseason. The 26-year-old cornerback started all 17 regular-season games last year and was selected to his second straight Pro Bowl.

Despite undergoing surgery on the AC joint in his right shoulder in January, Loveland was the first tight end off the board in this year's draft, going to the Bears 10th overall. He proceeded to miss the entire offseason program and acknowledged last week that he may not be ready once camp kicked off. The Bears seemingly will ease him in with the goal of getting him ready for Week 1.

Keenum was one of a few players added that Chicago placed on the active/NFI list Saturday. It's unclear what issue the 37-year-old was dealing with, but it won't keep him from hitting the practice field as the Bears open training camp Tuesday. Keenum joined the team on a one-year contract in April, and, while he'll likely compete with Tyson Bagent for the No. 2 quarterback role, his primary contribution should come as a mentor for Caleb Williams as he enters his second season as a starter.

Plenty of second-round picks from the 2025 NFL Draft have yet to sign, but Stewart is the lone first-rounder who remains unsigned. Rumors began to swirl earlier in the week that he might return to college after reports of him working out at College Station emerged. However, Conway reported that he was simply at the team's facility and not actually practicing with the team, while Adam Schefter of ESPN followed that up by reporting that Stewart will not be returning to the Texas A&amp;M Football team. That provides some clarity that Stewart is focused on his pro career, but the sides are running out of time to reach a deal before rookies report to training camp Saturday.

1115	598647	4239993?lang=en&region=us	7	Tee Higgins	WR	Active	Higgins said Wednesday at voluntary OTAs that he's adapted his offseason practice regimen to focus on preventing injuries, Geoff Hobson of the Bengals' official site reports.	Higgins, who inked a massive four-year, $115 million deal with the Bengals in March, said that in addition to focusing on strength and speed, his goal this offseason has been to "get my muscles right" and break his trend of lower-body soft-tissue injuries. Such issues forced him to miss five regular-season games in both 2023 and 2024. Even if he plays a full 17 regular-season games for the first time in his career, Higgins could have a tough time repeating his per-game efficiency from 2024, when he tallied 73 catches for 911 yards (on 109 targets) and a career-high 12 touchdowns across 12 appearances. A portion of Higgins' production can be attributed to Joe Burrow leading the league in pass attempts while struggling to compensate for Cincinnati's porous defense, which allowed 25.5 points per game. The Bengals failed to substantially revamp the defense this offseason, though, which could set the stage for a similar script in 2025, especially with Ja'Marr Chase and TE Mike Gesicki having re-signed to provide complete continuity on offense.

McPherson has been participating in Cincinnati's voluntary OTAs, indicating he's fully recovered from the abdomen injury that forced him to miss the team's final five games last season. The Florida product had the worst season of his NFL career in 2024, converting on just 16 of 22 field-goal attempts. Over the past two seasons, he's made only 52.6 percent of his field-goal tries (10 of 19) from 50 or more yards. However, he's missed just one of his last 78 extra-point attempts and appears poised for a bounce-back season in 2025.

Turner spent the last six games of the 2024 season on the sidelines healing from a broken collarbone, but he's now back on the field for offseason workouts. More promising yet for Turner is that he's drilling as a starter at corner opposite Cam Taylor-Britt. His primary competition for a starting job in 2025 will come from Dax Hill, Josh Newton and Jalen Davis.

Wilson finished the 2024 season on Cincinnati's injured reserve list after getting surgery on his knee in December, missing all of the last six games of the year. He now looks to be back in playing shape for the start of offseason workouts. Wilson will be going after a fifth straight year with 100-plus tackles in 2025.

Pickett got the nod Wednesday to operate as the team's first quarterback during 11-on-11, while Joe Flacco sat out the session. Flacco saw the first reps with the first-team offense during a modified 7-on-7 versus Cleveland's No. 1 back seven. Considering it was the team's first full-team workout, it'd be unwise to read into it deeply, but it appears Pickett is a step above rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, and he could be the early favorite to compete with Joe Flacco for the starting role in Week 1 versus the Bengals.

Flacco was the first quarterback up in the team's first modified 7-on-7 series against the team's No. 1 defensive back seven. He then shifted into being a spectator for the remainder of the day, handing the reins off to Kenny Pickett to begin the team's 11-on-11 session to end practice. Not much can be inferred about the quarterback pecking order in Cleveland after the team's first full-squad workout Wednesday, but it's worth monitoring as the days pass. Flacco and Pickett appear to be the frontrunners of the Browns' four-man quarterback competition, with rookies Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel fighting an uphill battle.

With 2025 second-rounder Quinshon Judkins unsigned amid legal issues, per Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal,  Ford's absence further taxes the Browns' running back depth at the onset of training camp. For now, Dylan Sampson, Pierre Strong and Ahmani Marshall are the team's available backfield options, but once Ford is back on the field, he'll profile as the team's RB1, given Judkins' situation, Daniel Oyefusi of ESPN.com notes.

1122	599173	4241463?lang=en&region=us	8	Jerry Jeudy	WR	Active	As training camp gets underway, Jeudy profiles as the Browns' clear-cut No. 1 wide receiver, Scott Petrak of the Elyria Chronicle-Telegram reports.	Jeudy is coming off a breakout campaign in 2024, during which he earned his first selection as a Pro Bowler while recording 90 catches (on 145 targets) for 1,229 yards and four TDs in 17 regular-season outings. In his second season with Cleveland, the 2020 first-rounder is entrenched as the top wideout, but slotting behind Jeudy has yet to be determined, with  Cedric Tillman and Diontae Johnson currently the top candidates emerge as the team's WR2. Additionally, it remains to be seen who Jeudy will be catching passes from come Week 1, given that the Browns' starting QB job is up for grabs. For now, Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders are the healthy signal-callers in the running for the assignment.

Bell dislocated his right hip in mid-September last year and ended the campaign on IR. He didn't participate in OTAs while continuing to recover from the issue, but it's telling that he was placed on the NFI list -- which is used for players dealing with injuries not suffered in practices or games -- rather than the PUP list. According to Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com, the issue that landed Bell on the NFI list isn't clear, and he may not be available for some time.

Hall hurt his knee in Week 18 of last year and had surgery during the offseason.

As expected, Watson will officially open training camp on the sidelines as he recovers from a second right Achilles procedure that he underwent in January. The quarterback is projected to miss the beginning of the 2025 campaign, and once healthy, it seems unlikely that the 29-year-old will regain the starting role in Cleveland. The Browns will enter camp with Joe Flacco,  Kenny Pickett,Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders as healthy options at QB.

He's one of the many unsigned second-round picks, with players and teams at odds over guaranteed money. The Browns won't necessarily be in any rush here, considering Judkins was arrested last week in Florida for domestic violence charges.

Hopkins was acquired from the Chargers ahead of the 2023 campaign and had a career year that season, drilling 33 of 36 field-goal attempts (91.7 percent) and 24 of 26 extra-point tries. Cleveland inked him to a three-year, $15.3 million extension through 2027, but the veteran kicker then posted the worst season of his career in 2024, making just 18 of 27 field goals (66.7 percent) and 17 of 20 extra points. The Browns have brought in Andre Szmyt to provide competition, but it sounds like Cleveland wants Hopkins to win this job. For fantasy purposes, the Browns don't project to be a high-scoring offense in 2025. That coupled with Hopkins' 2024 struggles don't make him a desirable target.

1128	598852	5081397?lang=en&region=us	8	Dylan Sampson	RB	Active	Browns running backs coach Duce Staley said at mandatory minicamp in mid-June that Sampson has gotten work "as a running back and a receiver," Dan Labbe of cleveland.com reports.	Staley also said that Sampson has worked with wide receivers coach Chad O'Shea, and that the rookie fourth-round pick "is able to go play in the slot and also he's able to go and play on third down and maybe sprinkle in a little second down." The running backs coach also noted that fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins, whom the Browns drafted two rounds ahead of Sampson, will be "able to do a little something [...] at receiver, too." Meanwhile, incumbent Jerome Ford has already demonstrated tangible pass-catching chops, and Staley praised his "speed" and ability to "pick up the blitz and catch the ball." While all three of Cleveland's top running backs could see tangible usage in the passing game, Labbe hypothesizes that as things currently stand Judkins and Sampson project to lead the Browns' revamped backfield, with Ford serving as the No. 3 back. Sampson didn't catch many passes in college at Tennessee, including as the team's starter in 2024, so it would come as a surprise if he in fact beats out Ford for passing-down reps at training camp, but if the rookie fourth-rounder can manage that feat he'll have a clear path to fantasy relevance in Year 1, especially in PPR formats.

1129	598851	4258620?lang=en&region=us	8	Andre Szmyt	PK	Active	The Browns signed Szmyt to a contract Thursday, Kelsey Russo of the team's official site reports.	Szmyt spent time on Cleveland's practice squad last December and began the offseason on the team's 90-man roster, but he was waived in early June to make room for second-year wideout Jaelen Gill. Now, with the Browns' release of Ogbonnia Okoronkwo, Szmyt gets an opportunity to re-sign with the team and provide competition for projected starting kicker Dustin Hopkins.

Other than inking a baggage-heavy Diontae Johnson to a one-year deal with zero guaranteed money, the Browns didn't do much during the offseason to upgrade the receiving corps. Tillman was having a breakout middle portion of the season in 2024 before a concussion forced him to miss the final six weeks -- he was back on the field for OTAs this summer. Following the departure of Amari Cooper last season, the Browns gave Tillman an opportunity, and he delivered. Over a four-game span, he caught 24 of 40 targets with three touchdowns. He's the biggest target (6-foot-3) among the receiving group and could be a factor in a passing game that may incorporate a lot of deep passes if Joe Flacco is the staring quarterback.

Cleveland invested significant stock in Fannin, taking him in the third round of April's NFL Draft. The Bowling Green product showed off serious pass-catching skills in college, tallying 117 receptions on 156 targets for 1,555 yards and 10 touchdowns in his final campaign. The reception and yardage totals were the most by a tight end in a single season in FBS history, though  at 6-foot-3, 241 pounds, Fannin is a bit undersized for his position in the NFL. That said, Browns tight ends coach Christian Jones praised Fannin for his strong hands and ability to track the ball following a strong practice Thursday, and the incoming rookie could immediately get looks in the Browns' offense alongside veteran TE David Njoku, who is heading into the final season of a four-year contract.

Coach Kevin Stefanski has said not to read into the order in which quarterbacks are getting reps, and the team has used seniority to organize its signal callers to this point. That lands Sanders last in line, as Dillon Gabriel was selected ahead of him in the 2025 NFL Draft. Jackson did note that Sanders has looked decisive and has delivered the ball quickly and confidently.

The 28-year-old is locked into a roster spot as the Cowboys' primary kick returner and as a depth option at wideout, but Turpin could be adding more duties to his portfolio. Dallas lacks an established starter in the backfield, with bargain free-agent signings Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders battling with rookies Jaydon Blue and Phil Mafah, as well as holdover Deuce Vaughn, for snaps and touches, and Turpin appears to be tossing his hat in the ring. While he's unlikely to win the top job outright, he could work in as part of a committee and provide a direct threat to Blue and Vaughn as an undersized speedster who can contribute as a receiver.

Overshown suffered a gruesome knee injury in Week 14 last season, blowing out his ACL, MCL and PCL in the process. He's fully expected to transfer to reserve/PUP to begin the season, which would cost him at least the first four games.

Coach Brian Schottenheimer told Nick Harris of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram before Tuesday's session that Parsons was in line to take part in drills, but that didn't come to pass. Speaking to the media afterward, the star edge rusher used the injury to dismiss talk of a "hold-in", but he is seeking a contract extension heading into the final year of his rookie deal. Parsons has been supremely productive in his first four years as a pro, recording at least 12.0 sacks every season and missing just five games overall, four of them in 2024.

"Now that he's in the over-30 club, we're going to be smart with some of the things we do with him," new head coach Brian Schottenheimer said Monday. "He is anti-that. He wants to do as much as possible. Luckily we have the trump card with him on that."	Prescott played just eight games last season before going down with a torn hamstring that required surgery, and while the 31-year-old has declared himself fully healthy to begin camp, Dallas isn't going to take any chances with him. The team's $240 million quarterback is likely to see little, if any, preseason action as well as the Cowboys focus on getting him ready for a Week 1 battle with the Super Bowl champion Eagles.

Prescott's 2024 campaign ended after Week 9 due to a torn hamstring that required surgery, and while the quarterback has declared himself fully healthy to begin camp, Dallas isn't taking any chances with him. Milton, a sixth-round pick of the Patriots in 2024 who was acquired in an April trade, is still something of a project, but the Cowboys are counting on him to be the No. 2 QB this season, so the more work he can get in camp, the better.

Revel dropped to 76th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft due to a torn ACL which he suffered in September.

Winfrey entered the NFL as a fourth-round pick by the Browns in 2022, and he appeared in 13 regular-season games as a rookie. He was cut the following summer and played in one game for the Jets in 2023 before spending the 2024 campaign out of the league. Winfrey played in the UFL with the Birmingham Stallions this spring and recently was named to the All-UFL Team. It was enough to earn Winfrey another chance to prove himself with an NFL club.

Rochell began the offseason with a brief stint in Kansas City, but he was let go by the Chiefs shortly after the 2025 NFL Draft. He'll now compete for a depth role in the Cowboys' secondary.

Given the alternatives, it's no surprise to see the two free-agent additions handling first-team work, even though both of them averaged less than 4.0 yards per carry in each of the past two seasons. The Cowboys' other running backs right now are rookie fifth-round pick Jaydon Blue, rookie seventh-round pick Phil Mafah and 2023 sixth-rounder Deuce Vaughn. It's anyone's guess how the depth chart might shift before Week 1, with possibilities including a late veteran addition via trade or free agency.

The defensive end tore his ACL and MCL during training camp last August and did not play in 2024. While he was only participating with a rehab group Thursday, he seems like he should be ready for this year's training camp. Williams, a 2022 second-round pick, has yet to start a game in his NFL career, though he did play in 35 contests between the regular season and playoffs over his first two seasons, recording 48 total tackles (30 solo), including 8.5 sacks.

Tolbert enjoyed a breakout of sorts in 2024, his third pro season, with a 49-610-7 receiving line on 79 targets, notably scoring on five of his seven catches inside the 10-yard line. He's never earned targets at a high rate, however, and even last season he saw the ball on just 14.8 percent of routes, the sixth-lowest mark among WRs with 500-plus routes. Tolbert's potential competition for the No. 3 role is explosive return man KaVontae Turpin, who ran only 201 routes last season but was targeted on 25.9 percent of them, and Jonathan Mingo, a 2023 second-round pick of the Panthers who has yet to make an impact as a pro.

1148	598219	4426354?lang=en&region=us	9	George Pickens	WR	Active	The Steelers are trading Pickens and a 2026 sixth-round pick to the Cowboys in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-rounder, Tommy Yarrish of the Cowboys' official site reports.	The Cowboys confirmed earlier reports of a trade, giving the team a huge upgrade at the No. 2 WR spot alongside superstar CeeDee Lamb. Fellow Dallas wideouts Jalen Tolbert and KaVontae Turpin drop down the depth chart, while Pittsburgh is left with Calvin Austin, Robert Woods and Roman Wilson as potential starters alongside March trade acquisition DK Metcalf. The trade is excellent news for Pickens' fantasy value, pairing him with QB Dak Prescott under new Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer in an offense that likely will throw the ball more often than the Steelers will. The 24-year-old Pickens topped 800 yards in each of his first three campaigns, including a career-high 1,140 in 2023, but he's never gone higher than 106 targets, 63 catches or five touchdowns in a single regular season.

Locke is healthy again after having undergone spinal fusion surgery earlier in the offseason.

Greenlaw was held out of OTAs and minicamp after sustaining a quadriceps injury while training in late April, but he has progressed enough in his recovery to be cleared for training camp. The veteran linebacker inked a three-year deal with the Broncos in March after spending the first six years of his NFL career with the 49ers. Greenlaw managed to play in two regular-season games in 2024 after recovering from a torn Achilles that he suffered during Super Bowl LVIII against the Chiefs.

Harvey, the 60th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, is thus poised to claim a key role in the Broncos' offense as a rookie. Also in the mix for the team's carries this coming season are J.K. Dobbins, Audric Estime and Jaleel McLaughlin, but among the four, Harvey is arguably the higher-upside play in fantasy, which is reflected by his ADP as training camp approaches.

Mims, who Denver selected in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft, is coming off a 2024 regular season in which he totaled 39 catches for 503 yards (on 52 targets) and six TDs in 17 games, but it's worth noting that the 23-year-old speedster logged a 32/447/6 receiving line over his last eight contests. Also competing for wideout targets ahead of Week 1 will be Devaughn Vele, Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant, but Mims' encouraging finish last year could foreshadow an uptick in production in his third season as a pro while working with second-year franchise QB Bo Nix.

Franklin had 2,274 receiving yards and 23 TDs over his final two seasons at Oregon, but he fell to the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft after checking in at just 172 pounds at the combine -- an unheard of weight for a 6-foot-2 wide receiver in the NFL. He's still among the thinnest players at his position, and coming off a low-impact rookie year with 263 yards on 53 targets, but Franklin may nonetheless be part of the competition this summer for Denver's Nos. 2 and 3 WR spots behind top target Courtland Sutton. The competition includes Marvin Mims, Devaughn Vele and rookie third-round pick Pat Bryant.

Dobbins racked up a career-high 1,058 scrimmage yards and nine total touchdowns across 13 regular-season appearances with the Chargers in 2024, and he now joins rookie RJ Harvey atop the depth chart of the Broncos' revamped backfield. An MCL sprain forced Dobbins to miss four games during his one-year stint with Los Angeles, but after missing 2021 due to a multi-ligament knee injury, having the same issue linger into 2022 and requiring surgery, and then suffering a torn Achilles tendon Week 1 of 2023, for Dobbins to average 4.6 YPC and play 13 regular-season games represents one of the most remarkable comeback seasons in recent memory. Both Dobbins and Harvey project as valuable fantasy contributors in coach Sean Payton's offense, which averaged the 10th most points per game (25.0) in the NFL last season and could make a sizable leap with Bo Nix entering Year 2.

Engram said Thursday he feels "the potential is through the roof" for second-year quarterback Bo Nix, per DiLalla, and the veteran tight end projects to be a significant part of the young signal-caller's Year 2 development. Now fully recovered from the hamstring and labrum injuries that limited him to nine regular-season appearances with Jacksonville in 2024, Engram is entrenched as Denver's top tight end above Adam Trautman, and he's staring down a seemingly straightforward path to emerging as the No. 2 option in the passing game behind top wideout Courtland Sutton. Marvin Mims, Devaughn Vele and Troy Franklin project as complementary options and are joined by rookie third-rounder Pat Bryant, but Engram is clearly the Broncos' most proficient target outlet for short passes, even if his prime is in the past as he enters his age-31 season. Zac Stevens of TheDNVR.com reports that Engram's usage at OTAs suggests a key role in the passing game.

Prieskorn went unselected in April's NFL Draft but subsequently inked a deal with Detroit. He was waived May 12 before landing with the Broncos on Tuesday.

1160	598514	4569682?lang=en&region=us	10	Audric Estime	RB	Active	Broncos head coach Sean Payton said Thursday that Estime is a "back that requires enough touches" and "just didn't have enough as a rookie," but is "going to get those opportunities" during the 2025 season, Mike Klis of 9News Denver reports.	Estime and fellow incumbent Jaleel McLaughlin opened OTAs taking the majority of first-team running back reps, but courtesy of his second-round draft capital, it shouldn't take long for rookie RJ Harvey to climb the depth chart. A 2024 fifth-round pick, Estime racked up 76 carries for 310 yards and two touchdowns across 14 regular-season games as a rookie, while securing all five of his targets for 27 yards and fumbling twice (one lost). He was also a healthy scratch for the team's wild-card round playoff loss to the Bills. Harvey's addition to the backfield figures to more than account for the touches vacated by Javonte Williams' departure for Dallas in free agency, but Payton appears to still envision a clear role for Estime, even acknowledging that his bruising rushing style requires ample opportunities to wear down opposing defenses. At 5-foot-11, 227-pounds, Estime could operate as a 'thunder' complement to the 5-foot-8, 205-pound Harvey's 'lightning,' though the latter tailback demonstrated an ability to withstand a workhorse role during his time at UCF.

The wide receiver participated in the team's recent rookie minicamp on a tryout basis, per DiLalla. In 2024 with Utah State, White finished with 44 catches for 526 yards and three touchdowns and eight kickoff returns for 188 yards, his only statistically significant collegiate season. Denver's wide receiver depth chart includes four players, Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims, Devaughn Vele and Troy Franklin, who caught passes for the team in 2024 as well as 2025 third-round pick Pat Bryant, but White could perhaps compete for a spot behind them.

The addition of competition was a matter of when, not if, after the Broncos lost Javonte Williams (Cowboys) from a backfield that was among the league's worst in 2024. McLaughlin caught on with the team as an undrafted rookie in 2023 and has proven elusive while averaging 4.8 YPC on 189 career rush attempts, but there's no real precedent for mainstream fantasy value from a running back his size (5-foot-7, 187 pounds) who isn't an asset in the passing game. McLaughlin has scored four of his six TDs on receptions, but with a meager average of 4.3 yards on 55 catches. He'll hope to be part of a committee again in 2025, with some risk of falling out of the picture in the event Harvey (5-foot-8, 205 pounds with 4.4 speed) proves himself a capable workhorse.

Allen worked with the second-team offense to open training camp Sunday before Hendon Hooker replaced him with the second-team unit Monday. Allen signed with the Lions in the offseason, and he'll compete with Hooker for the backup quarterback role behind Jared Goff this season. The 29-year-old hasn't played in any meaningful action since 2022 with the Texans, when he completed 46 of 78 passes for 416 yards and two touchdowns, while also throwing four interceptions, in two starts with the team. Hooker spent the majority of the 2024 campaign as Goff's primary backup and likely has the early edge over Allen for the No. 2 role.

Hooker was operating with the third-team offense behind Jared Goff and Kyle Allen during Sunday's first practice of training camp. The quarterback stepped it up a notch Monday, but he appears to be in a direct competition with Allen for the backup role ahead of the 2025 campaign. Hooker operated in the No. 2 role for the 2024 regular season but was moved to emergency QB in favor of veteran Teddy Bridgewater for the playoffs. Hooker has reportedly shown a strong early rapport with rookie wideouts Isaac TeSlaa and Dominic Lovett, according to Colton Pouncy of The Athletic, but Hooker will have to get some more work with the starters in order for Detroit to get a full read on him prior to his third year in Detroit.

Goff compiled a career-high 4,629 passing yards and 37 passing touchdowns while completing 72 percent of his pass attempts over 17 regular-season games in 2024. The 30-year-old has been the picture of consistency, appearing in all 51 of the Lions' regular-season contests over the last three years. With offensive coordinator Ben Johnson leaving in the offseason to become the head coach with the Bears, Goff will work with new OC John Morton, who was a senior offensive assistant in Detroit in 2022 before spending two years with the Broncos as the team's passing game coordinator. Morton is considered to be a maestro with wide receivers, and Detroit added third-rounder Isaac TeSlaa to the fold in the 2025 NFL Draft. He'll join an already talented wide receiver room that includes Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams, Tim Patrick and Kalif Raymond. The wide receivers paired with impressive running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery, as well as tight end Sam LaPorta, will provide Jared Goff with a wide array of options to once again have a productive campaign in the Motor City.

The Lions lost center Frank Ragnow to retirement and right guard Kevin Zeitler to the Titans, leaving a training camp competition between rookie second-round pick Tate Ratledge, 2024 sixth-rounder Christian Mahogany and 27-year-old Trystan Colon, among others, for the two open spots. Morton, who was Detroit's passing-game coordinator the last two years under former OC Ben Johnson, still has an elite tackle duo and one of the best groups of skill-position players in the league at his disposal. There's always some chance the new play-caller gives Jahmyr Gibbs a few more snaps and touches at Montgomery's expense, but wholesale changes are unlikely after the Lions scored a league-high 33.2 points per game last season.

McNeill tore his ACL in December and was placed on the active/PUP list Thursday. With McNeill's absence expected to stretch well into the regular season and Levi Onwuzurike (knee) already ruled out for the entire 2025 campaign, the Lions will be shorthanded on the interior of the defensive line.

Davenport showed no ill effects from the triceps injury that ended his 2024 campaign in Week 3, as Twentyman notes that Davenport looked like the best player on the field in Monday's practice. The veteran pass rusher is penciled in as a starter despite having only 3.0 sacks in 21 games over the past three regular seasons.

Anzalone's locked in as a starter when healthy, but he's back on the mend again in training camp after being limited to 10 regular-season appearances in 2024 by a broken forearm.

Eric Woodyard of ESPN.com previously reported that St. Brown underwent an offseason knee procedure, "just to clean some stuff up," in the words of the wideout. At the time, Woodyard indicated that St. Brown was expected to be ready for training camp, and that is indeed the case, with no reports of the 25-year-old being limited at practice. St. Brown thus is set to reprise his high-volume role in Detroit's offense, after having racked up 115 catches (on 141 targets) for 1,263 yards and 12 TDs in 17 regular-season contests in 2024.

This is a tough blow for Onwuzurike and the Lions, who were decimated by injuries on defense last year. Onwuzurike was a key part of Detroit's defensive line during the 2024 campaign, playing in 16 regular-season games and recording 16 tackles, including 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble while logging over 60 percent of the team's defensive snaps 11 times.  Presumed starter at defensive tackle Alim McNeill is recovering from a torn ACL himself, and it's unclear if he'll be ready for Week 1 of the upcoming campaign.

Small spent the 2024 season with the Titans' practice squad after joining the team as an undrafted free agent.

The defensive tackle suffered a season-ending knee injury on Thanksgiving Day last year in a win over the Bears. Wingo can technically return in time for the Lions' preseason opener this year against the Chargers on July 31, though that remains a question after he underwent surgery. In 11 games as a rookie, the 2024 sixth rounder played on 162 defensive snaps and 44 special-teams snaps, finishing with nine tackles (one solo).

Rodriguez is eligible to return from the list at any time throughout training camp and the preseason. However, he tore his ACL last November in a win over the Bears and in June, Detroit coach Dan Campbell estimated that the linebacker could perhaps return by November of this season, per Eric Woodyard of ESPN.com.

Melton received reps at corner during minicamp in June. It appears the 2022 seventh-rounder will officially make the switch to defense, though he'll likely operate as a depth piece in the secondary behind Keisean Nixon, Carrington Valentine and Nate Hobbs. Melton appeared in all 17 regular-season games for the Packers in 2024 and posted eight catches (on 17 targets) for 91 yards while adding eight carries for 54 yards.

Walker spent five days on the active/PUP list before getting the all-clear to practice, which may come to pass as soon as Thursday. After the Packers opted not to pick up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract back in May, the 2022 first-round pick is set to play out the final year of that deal in 2025, when he'll be seeking his fourth 100-tackle campaign in as many seasons as a pro. The emergence of 2024 second-round, off-ball linebacker Edgerrin Cooper could hinder that effort, however.

Watson suffered his ACL tear in Week 18 last season, giving him almost exactly nine months between the date of the injury and Week 1 of 2025. He's starting training camp on the PUP list, with Gutekunst's comments Wednesday suggesting Watson might remain out of practice for a while. Week 1 may still be a big ask, but it at least sounds like Watson is on schedule (or ahead of it) in his rehab process, with a chance to contribute in the first half of the season. The Packers open training camp with Jayden Reed, Matthew Golden, Romeo Doubs and Dontayvion Wicks are their top wide receivers.

McNamee becomes Green Bay's designated player in the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, claiming the slot previously held by fellow kicker Alex Hale (eye). McNamee is a native of Ireland who most recently played with the BC Lions in the Canadian Football League. Brandon McManus is slated to serve as the Packers' primary kicker in 2025, but McNamee will be given the opportunity to develop, presumably as part of the organization's practice squad.

Per Pelissero, Tom's extension is for $88 million, with a maximum value of $92 million.

Johnson joined the Packers as an undrafted free agent after a very productive collegiate career with South Dakota State as both a running back and kick returner. However, he was facing an uphill battle to make the roster out of training camp, and starting out on the sideline won't help his cause.

1189	598944	4047365?lang=en&region=us	12	Josh Jacobs	RB	Active	Jacobs remains the Packers' unquestioned No. 1 running back entering the 2025 season, but his primary backup is to be determined, Mike Spofford of the team's official site reports.	Green Bay seemingly used a third-round pick in the 2024 Draft on MarShawn Lloyd to solidify its reserve RB ranks behind Jacobs, but Lloyd managed just one appearance (and seven touches) as a rookie due to a variety of health concerns. With Lloyd sidelined for most of last season, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks combined for 161 touches, which was a far cry from Jacobs' 337. Jacobs boasts four campaigns of 1,000-plus rushing yards in his six-year career, and considering the workload he handled in 2024, he's set to take on a similar burden this year. Still, if Lloyd proves his health and sheds his fumble-prone label from college, he could swap places with Wilson as the No. 2 option in the Packers backfield.

Hardman finished the 2024 season on Kansas City's injured reserve list with a knee issue, but it doesn't seem to be hindering him anymore with offseason workouts now underway. Hardman will have to do everything he can to try to impress Green Bay's coaching staff, as he might not be a lock to make the final 53-man roster after the team added Matthew Golden and Savion Williams via the draft.

Doubs, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, has gained full clearance to participate in OTAs after he sustained a concussion during Green Bay's wild-card round loss to the Eagles in January. Jayden Reed (shoulder) and newcomer Mecole Hardman (knee) are also practicing Wednesday. Rookie first-round pick Matthew Golden and third-rounder Savion Williams represent additional notable additions to the Packers' wide receiver corps, which also returns Dontayvion Wicks and Christian Watson (ACL) in what looks like one of the league's most crowded units, though Watson's recovery could realistically sideline him until mid-season. Reed appears destined to dominate slot reps, and general manager Brian Gutekunst has talked him up as Green Bay's top wideout, while Golden's draft capital and playmaking ability give the team every incentive to find him a starting role. Doubs has proven himself as a jack-of-all-trades and a capable starter, but he's now entering a contract year facing tough competition for targets and snaps.

Reed appears back to full health after having suffered a dislocated shoulder during Green Bay's 22-10 wild-card loss to the Eagles in January, an injury for which he didn't require surgery. The third-year pro has prioritized bulking up early in the offseason, with passing-game coordinator Jason Vrable saying in mid-May that Reed is currently 199 pounds after playing at 187 pounds in 2024. The Packers' selection of Matthew Golden in the first round of April's draft, plus Savion Williams in the third round, provides Jordan Love and the passing game the requisite tools to grow more dynamic in 2025, a development that could prove positive for Reed in Year 3 even if he faces increased target competition. Romeo Doubs (concussion) and newcomer Mecole Hardman (knee) are also practicing Wednesday.

Alexander and Sam Warren of the Houston Chronicle reports.	Harris is still dealing with the calf injury that forced him to miss 13 regular-season games last year.

Berrios made his practice debut Wednesday and played with the second and third-team quarterbacks. He reportedly had a good day, which he'll likely need to stack to make the roster. Berrios is also a good special-teams contributor, which could be another path to him sticking with the team.

Alexander of The Houston Chronicle reports.	While Caserio hasn't completely ruled out the possibility that Dell could return at some point this season, it's clear that the wideout --  who suffered a significant knee injury last December -- still has a way to go in his recovery process. With that in mind, Caserio noted that Dell is "in the building every day. He's working really hard, but we're not going to put a timetable on anything," a notion echoed by coach DeMeco Ryans, who added that the 2023 third-rounder is "crushing the rehab." With Dell likely to miss a good portion of the coming season, the Texans' top healthy veteran wide receivers are Nico Collins and Christian Kirk, with 2025 draftees Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel also in the mix to carve out steady roles in the team's passing attack.

Ward missed nine regular-season games for the Texans last season with both a concussion and, separately, a foot injury. Early in the offseason, head coach DeMeco Ryans said the 34-year-old was "doing fine" in the progression of his foot injury, according to Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston. With injuries limiting him to just 20 regular-season games over the past two campaigns, the team is taking a cautious approach with the veteran safety, but he can return at any point in the preseason should the team deem him ready.

Tavai landed on the PUP list Saturday due to a calf injury that he sustained during OTAs in early June. He progressed enough in his recovery to pass his physical, and the 2019 second-rounder has been cleared to participate in practices and preseason games. Tavai has logged 100-plus tackles in two consecutive seasons and has played in every regular-season game since 2022.

Taylor was essentially a rotational practice-squad back for Houston last year, playing in five regular-season contests and totaling 33 offensive snaps. It's unclear what injury Taylor may be dealing with, but the Texans may just be being cautious with their veterans as the team placed 13 players on either the non-football injury list or PUP list before the start of training camp. The 27-year-old can return to the practice field at any point in the preseason should the team deem him ready, and he will likely need to do so quickly, as Taylor could be competing with newly drafted fourth-round pick Woody Marks for a roster spot.

It's not entirely clear what Fatukasi is dealing with, but the defensive lineman did miss the final three games of the regular season last year due to an ankle injury. The Texans overall might be taking a cautious approach with a number of their veterans, as 13 players were either placed on the non-football injury list or PUP list to begin training camp. The 30-year-old Fatukasi re-signed with Houston on a one-year deal late in the offseason and is expected to be a key rotational defensive lineman much like he was last season.

The team is likely taking precaution with the veteran, as Autry played through a knee injury throughout much of last season. The 35-year-old is entering his 12th NFL campaign and tallied 3.0 sacks over 10 regular-season games in his first year with Houston last season. He played a rotational role on the defensive line and will likely reprise a similar role for a largely unchanged front four.

Pittman experienced some knee soreness during the final day of Indianapolis' voluntary OTAs last month, but he's good to go for training camp and set to reprise his key role in wideout corps that also returns Alec Pierce, Josh Downs and Adonai Mitchell. One major question that remains to be settled, however, is which QB they'll be catching passes from in Week 1, with Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones currently competing for the starting job.

Erickson of the Indianapolis Star reports.	The report notes that the Colts held four team periods in Wednesday's session, with Jones working with the starters for the first two, while Richardson handled the first-team snaps during the final two, which fits with coach Shane Steichen's plan to alternate the two signal-callers in training camp as they compete for the Week 1 starting assignment. Though there's a chance that Richardson could have some volume restrictions in the coming days (in particular during low-leverage portions of practice) after experiencing soreness in his throwing shoulder this summer, the plan is for the 2023 first-rounder to handle team reps, an approach that will allow him to contend with Jones in a job battle that Steichen noted is "really going to come down to who's the most consistent" this summer, JJ Stankevitz of the Colts' official site previously reported.

Erickson of the Indianapolis Star reports.	Per the report, the Colts held four team periods during Wednesday's session, with  Jones working with the starters for the first two, while Richardson took the first-team snaps during the final two. In the process, each quarterback was given 16 team snaps, which aligns with coach Shane Steichen's plan to alternate the two signal-callers in training camp as they compete for the Week 1 starting assignment. While there's a chance that Richardson could have some volume restrictions in the coming days after experiencing soreness in his throwing shoulder this summer, the 2023 first-rounder was cleared to participate in training camp, setting the stage for a job battle that Steichen noted is "really going to come down to who's the most consistent" as the summer progresses, JJ Stankevitz of the Colts' official site previously reported.

1212	599115	3124005?lang=en&region=us	14	Zaire Franklin	LB	Questionable	Franklin (ankle) will not be ready for the start of training camp, Joel Erickson of the Indianapolis Star reports.	Franklin underwent a clean-up procedure on his left ankle earlier in the offseason and isn't quite ready to practice. He's been running, but there isn't a clear timetable for his return to full strength. Franklin started all 17 regular-season contests last season, registering an NFL-high 173 tackles (93 solo), including a career-best 3.5 sacks, six pass breakups, including a pair of interceptions, and five forced fumbles. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl and was named a second-team All-Pro. Franklin also received Defensive Player of the Year votes.

1213	599066	4242335?lang=en&region=us	14	Jonathan Taylor	RB	Active	Free-agent signee Khalil Herbert and rookie fifth-round pick DJ Giddens are expected to compete for backup RB roles behind Taylor, ESPN.com's Stephen Holder reports.	The Colts also still have third-year back Tyler Goodson, who took 43 touches for 214 yards and two TDs last season while splitting work with Trey Sermon (now in Pittsburgh) in the three games Taylor missed. Taylor played a career-high 79.9 percent of snaps in his 14 active games last year, up from 57.7 percent in 2023, 70.2 percent in 2022 and 68.9 percent in 2021. He could lose a few snaps/touches in 2025 if the backup situation improves, but neither Giddens nor Herbert is likely to handle a significant workload. Taylor has averaged at least 17.9 touches and 89.4 total yards per game in each of his five pro seasons, albeit with minimal receiving production and repeated ankle injuries the past few years.

"We think (Carlies) can really ascend," GM Chris Ballard said recently.	Carlies moved from safety to linebacker last season and started six games. He recorded 36 total tackles, including 1.0 sacks, and one pass defended over 231 defensive snaps in 10 games.

"Spencer certainly has a little bit of a step up in that. He's already been in the league, already been here, but it is definitely an open competition," said Mason.	Shrader inked a two-year deal with the Colts in mid-March after a tumultuous rookie campaign, in which he appeared in four combined games between Indianapolis, Kansas City and the Jets. He converted all five of his field-goal tries and all nine extra-point attempts across those appearances. The Colts will have a new kicker this season after releasing Matt Gay in April. While Shrader's two-year contract likely indicates he's the favorite, it wouldn't be surprising if Trujillo wins the job or if the team acquires another veteran late in training camp for the job. Shrader will need to have a strong preseason as a result.	Unknown	Unknown	Not Specified	Not Specified	\N	\N	2025-06-16 19:59:00	A	2025-07-24 15:59:43.50829	2025-07-24 15:59:43.50829

Jones was one of four players on the Colts defense to record 100-plus tackles last season and started all 17 regular-season games.

Brents sustained a groin injury during Indianapolis' 2024 season finale, but his participation in Wednesday's OTAs suggests he's moved past the issue. The third-year corner from Kansas State has struggled to stay healthy in the NFL, appearing in just 11 regular-season games throughout his career. In that span, Brents has tallied 57 total tackles, six passes defended, including one interception, and one forced fumble. Now fully healthy, he's expected to serve as one of Indianapolis' top reserve cornerbacks in 2025.

Goncalves exited the Colts' 2024 season finale with a concussion, but it appears he's moved past the issue.

Mang will finally get an opportunity to make an impression at the pro level in 2025 after spending five years at Syracuse. He never put up eye-popping numbers as a pass catcher, but his 6-foot-7, 267-pound frame suggests he might be able to move defenders off their spots in the run game.

Ebukam missed the 2024 season after suffering a torn Achilles tendon during a July 28 practice. The Colts must believe he'll be able to return, as he has a $10.49 million cap  hit for 2025 and the team could have saved $6.49 million with his release. Ebukam had 9.5 sacks in 2023, but he'll have a daunting task returning to form coming back from an injury that could limit his explosiveness.

The Jaguars haven't disclosed the exact nature of Smith's injury. However, it appears the 2024 second-round pick's injury isn't serious, which should open the door for him to participate in training camp and the preseason.

Coen wants Hunter to start training camp with a few days only on offense and a few only on defense before shifting to both on the same day within a week or two. Coen said in April that Hunter would start the offseason program focusing on offense, with subsequent quotes from Jaguars GM James Gladstone suggesting Hunter is more naturally comfortable on defense and needed to focus on learning Coen's playbook. It sounds like Hunter is preparing to play on offense and defense come Week 1, although he might only be a part-time player on one or both sides of the ball.

1226	598986	4334300?lang=en&region=us	15	Dennis Gardeck	LB	Out	The Jaguars placed Gardeck (knee) on the active/PUP list Saturday.	Gardeck tore his ACL in Week 7 of last season and is still rehabbing the injury. The veteran linebacker signed with the Jaguars in early June, but it's not clear when he'll be ready to suit up. That said, he can be activated at any point during the preseason, at which point he'll be eligible to begin practicing.

1327	598278	4430656?lang=en&region=us	21	Myles Price	WR	Active	Price signed with the Vikings as an undrafted free agent Friday, Craig Peters of the team's official site reports.	Price spent the first four years of his collegiate career at Texas Tech before transferring to Indiana in 2024. The 5-foot-9 wideout was one of Indiana's top playmakers during the team's College Football Playoff run last season, catching 38 passes for 466 yards and three touchdowns. He also added seven carries for 63 yards and one rushing touchdown. While Price is likely an extra body for offseason activities, he could earn a spot on the Vikings' practice squad if he impresses this summer.

1411	598786	4047650?lang=en&region=us	27	DK Metcalf	WR	Active	Metcalf said at mandatory minicamp that while establishing a rapport with new quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the veteran signal-caller's "playmaking ability after a play breaks down" and "how quickly he releases the ball" have both stood out, Mike DeFabo of The Athletic reports.	Since being dealt to Pittsburgh and signing a five-year, $150 million deal with his new team, Metcalf's outlook has improved significantly. The Steelers' signing of Rodgers to a one-year deal provides Metcalf with short-term stability at quarterback plus a signal-caller with the necessary timing to complement the strengths of his route tree. Moreover, the decision to trade George Pickens to Dallas leaves Metcalf entrenched as the unquestioned top target in the Steelers' passing game, with all of Robert Woods, Calvin Austin, Roman Wilson and TE Pat Freiermuth as ancillary options. Offensive coordinator Arthur Smith also indicated that his usual run-heavy tendencies could shift in 2025, saying "we didn't bring [Rodgers] in here and sign [Metcalf] for all that money to go run the wishbone," and that "you try to play to the strengths of your team."

After winning the national championship during his lone season at Ohio State in 2024, Howard was selected by the Steelers in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. Rodgers and the Steelers had been continually linked in rumors during the offseason, but if a deal between the two sides hadn't materialized, Howard could have had an opportunity to compete with Mason Rudolph for a starting role. Instead, Howard will turn his focus toward a developmental role in 2025, but Rodgers said Tuesday that he plans to help the rookie as much as possible this season.

Rudolph opened OTAs as the Steelers' No. 1 option at quarterback, but Rodgers had been continually linked to the team during the offseason. A one-year deal between Rodgers and Pittsburgh finally materialized Saturday, meaning that Rudolph will be left to compete with Will Howard for the team's No. 2 quarterback job ahead of the 2025 campaign. Rudolph will likely continue to handle a slightly elevated role for the remainder of OTAs while Rodgers acclimates to the team. However, Rudolph expressed openness to the impending move to a backup role, especially once training camp begins next month.

The tight end tore his Achilles during OTAs on Tuesday, but this move confirms that he's out for the season. Parham signed with the Steelers in February, spent most of 2024 on Denver's practice squad and last caught an NFL pass in 2023 with the Chargers. That was also his best season, when he grabbed 27 passes for 285 yards and four scores.

Johnston signed a three-year contract with the Steelers in March of last year, but he hurt his right knee in Week 1 against Atlanta and ended up on IR for the remainder of the campaign.

The 24-year-old missed Pittsburgh's final 12 regular-season games in 2024 due to a neck injury, but he now appears to be past the issue. Leal played just 76 total snaps (50 defensive and 26 on special teams) over five games in 2024, recording four total tackles.

Fautanu was the Steelers' first-round draft pick in 2024 but suffered a knee injury during the team's Week 2 win over Denver that landed him on injured reserve for the remainder of his rookie season.

Offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb, QB Geno Smith, and WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett are out, replaced by Klint Kubiak, Sam Darnold, Cooper Kupp and Marquez Valdes-Scantling, respectively. Seattle's backfield, on the other hand, looks the same as last year, with Walker and Charbonnet atop the depth chart while Kenny McIntosh fends off competition for the No. 3 job. There have been some beat-writer whispers about Charbonnet potentially challenging Walker for the starting job under a new coaching staff, although nobody from the Seahawks has said anything to that effect.

Fullbacks are a dying breed in the NFL, but as Bell reports, offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak used one on 25 percent of the Saints' plays last season. The Seahawks affirmed their commitment to the position by selecting Ouzts in the fifth round and immediately converting him from tight end to fullback where he started with Kenneth Walker on Thursday. Ouzts is currently competing with third-year pro Brady Russell for the starting job.

Nwosu was placed on the active/PUP list Thursday as he continues to recover from offseason knee surgery, but he's not close to returning to action apparently. Head coach Mike Macdonald implied Wednesday that the linebacker could be sidelined into the regular season, saying that the linebacker will be out "probably throughout the rest of camp and then we'll go from there."  Nwosu dealt with a series of injuries in 2024, including knee, thigh and wrist issues, and the team will likely ensure he's back to full strength before he returns to practice.

Head coach Mike Macdonald confirmed Wednesday that Hankins was diagnosed with a back injury, but there's optimism that the issue won't keep the veteran sidelined for the long term. Hankins opted to re-sign with the Seahawks in late April after a solid 2024 campaign in which he recorded 30 tackles (15 solo), including 1.0 sacks, and an interception in 17 regular-season games.

1424	599225	4567048?lang=en&region=us	28	Kenneth Walker III	RB	Active	Coach Mike Macdonald said Wednesday that Walker (ankle) was a full practice participant to begin training camp, Brady Henderson of ESPN.com reports. "He looks great. He's in a great spot mentally," Macdonald added. "Awesome to see him do all the things we want him to do from the get-go. I know he's really excited about what's going on. Great first day with Ken."	Walker managed just one appearance (Week 16) over the final five regular-season games of the 2024 campaign due to an ankle injury, which also limited him during the offseason program. Now that he's back to 100 percent, the three-year pro can focus on maintaining a foothold on the No. 1 spot on the running back depth chart for the Seahawks. In the 11 contests in which both he and backup Zach Charbonnet played last year, the former racked up 199 touches to the latter's 67, a breakdown that should remain similar as long as both players are healthy.

1425	599170	3912547?lang=en&region=us	28	Sam Darnold	QB	Active	Darnold will take the first-team quarterback reps when training camp starts Wednesday, and there isn't a quarterback competition with rookie third-round pick Jalen Milroe, Brady Henderson of ESPN.com reports.	This sentiment has been echoed by multiple Seahawks beat writers as well as head coach Mike McDonald. Milroe is an intriguing prospect with massive upside, specifically with his running ability and arm strength, but his accuracy remains a significant question mark and will need time to develop. Regardless, Darnold signed a three-year, $100.5 million contract with $55 million guaranteed this offseason after revitalizing his career with the Vikings in 2024, throwing for 4,319 yards (7.9 YPA), 35 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Darnold enjoyed throwing behind one of the league's best offensive lines last season, but there are serious question marks about Seattle's young offensive line. Furthermore, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and an aging Cooper Kupp don't provide the same explosiveness as Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, making this a true prove-it year. Still, Darnold's production was so strong last season that he could live up to his contract expectations even if he regresses a bit.

A rookie second-round pick, Arroyo was going to be in the mix for the starting job regardless, but Fant's departure opens the door further. Arroyo (6-foot-5, 254 pounds) struggled with knee injuries during his second and third seasons at Miami before reeling in 35 passes for 590 yards and seven touchdowns in his final collegiate campaign. He didn't test at the NFL Combine or pro day due to a knee injury, but he's considered a standout athlete anyway. Barner is considered a better blocker and held his own as a rookie, starting six of 17 games and finishing with a 30-245-4 line. According to Michael-Shawn Dugar of The Athletic, Arroyo impressed at rookie minicamp with his ability to challenge safeties with his size and speed. There's probably room for both tight ends to have significant roles in this offense, but for fantasy purposes, Arroyo has the more compelling upside.

1427	599023	4576297?lang=en&region=us	28	AJ Barner	TE	Active	Barner will compete with rookie Elijah Arroyo for the starting tight end job after the Seahawks released Noah Fant on Sunday, Bob Condotta of The Seattle Times reports.	The Seahawks selected Arroyo in the second round of April's draft and signed Eric Saubert this offseason, allowing them the flexibility to move on from Fant with one year left on his deal. A 2024 fourth-round pick, Barner started six games as a rookie and finished with 30 receptions for 245 yards and four touchdowns over 17 games. Barner will face stiff competition from Arroyo for the starting job in 2025. Arroyo is likely the better athlete of the two and should eventually command more attention in the passing game, but Barner will look to leverage his experience to hold off the newcomer.

Lucas suffered an injury to his abdomen late last season and was placed on IR ahead of Seattle's regular-season finale. Van Til reports that Lucas "appears to be in great shape and moving well" while working with the first-team offense during OTAs, so he seems to be mostly healthy again, though he implied Wednesday that he's not quite 100 percent. Lucas' health this season will be a key factor for Seattle's offensive line, as the 2022 third-rounder is slated to start at right tackle.

Jackson also dealt with blood clots in 2022 but was ultimately able to resume playing. That said, the condition isn't easy to navigate, and McVay has deemed Jackson's status as being "a day at a time." Jackson will be allowed to participate in jog-throughs at the start of training camp but won't do any physical on-field work. If he's not ready to play by Week 1, the recently signed D.J.

According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Williams was a candidate to stage a hold-in until he got a new deal, but the running back himself dismissed that idea, telling Sarah Barshop of ESPN.com that he'll take the field throughout training camp and even Week 1 if a new contract hasn't been worked out. Williams remains the Rams' unquestioned No. 1 RB on the heels of back-to-back 1,000-yard campaigns on the ground in which he also combined for 31 total touchdowns in 28 regular-season games. Next up behind Williams on the depth chart are 2024 third-round pick Blake Corum and rookie fourth-rounder Jarquez Hunter.

1439	599072	4426515?lang=en&region=us	29	Puka Nacua	WR	Active	Nacua and Davante Adams are entrenched as the top two options in the Rams' revamped WR room, ESPN.com's Sarah Barshop reports.	Nacua is the only returning regular starter at wide receiver, with Cooper Kupp (Seahawks) and Demarcus Robinson (49ers) now playing for NFC West rivals. Tutu Atwell and Jordan Whittington are set to compete for the No. 3 job, which probably won't entail a ton of targets when both Nacua and Adams are healthy. Playing alongside Adams instead of Kupp will make it even harder for Nacua to approach last year's unsustainable, league-high 39.1 percent target rate, but he can potentially make up for a reduced share by playing more snaps (he took 487 in 11 regular-season games last year) and scoring more TDs (three).

Since signing with the Rams as an undrafted free agent in 2023 and also spent time with the UFL's Memphis Showboats during the spring league's 2025 season. Winn has yet to appear in an NFL regular-season game, however, and he faces an uphill climb this year as well on a depth chart that features Matthew Stafford, Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett ahead of him.

Ferguson had been among the second-round picks of the 2025 Draft class holding out for more guaranteed money in their rookie contracts, and Schefter now reports that he gets roughly $8 million of his four-year, $9.7 million deal guaranteed. Ferguson's draft capital and pass-catching chops promise real upside in the Rams' offense, surpassing 32-year-old incumbent starter Tyler Higbee. However, Higbee is healthy after missing most of 2024 due to injury, and he will provide a notable challenge for the rookie. Higbee is slated to hit free agency next offseason, however.

1442	598809	4360307?lang=en&region=us	29	Derion Kendrick	CB	Active	Los Angeles signed Kendrick to a contract Tuesday.	The Rams recently waived Kendrick on Friday, but it appears the team always intended to reunite with the 2022 sixth-round pick. Kendrick missed the entire 2024 campaign due to a torn ACL but had been participating in OTAs and was waived without an injury designation, indicating that he's fully healthy. He started 12 of 17 regular-season appearances in 2023 and will now compete with Darious Williams and Ahkello Witherspoon to regain a key role at cornerback.

1443	598776	2971048?lang=en&region=us	29	D.J. Humphries	OT	Active	Humphries signed with the Rams on Thursday, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.	The offensive tackle was initially negotiating with the 49ers earlier in the spring, but no deal came together even though Humphries' representation announced that it did. Humphries tore his ACL late in the 2023 season with the Cardinals, got released the following March, signed with the Chiefs in November and then dealt with a hamstring issue late in the 2024 regular season. Humphries has started all 100 regular-season games he's appeared in during his career, but he's expected to provide depth behind Alaric Jackson and Rob Havenstein in Los Angeles.

1444	598756	16800?lang=en&region=us	29	Davante Adams	WR	Active	Adams said Tuesday that he feels rejuvenated with the Rams, Adam Grosbard of The Orange County Register reports.	Adams had a nice run for fantasy purposes with the Jets last season, but he caught just 58.8 percent of his targets in 11 games, relying on massive volume (114 targets) and touchdowns (seven) rather than per-target efficiency. That was also the case for most of his time in Las Vegas, where he caught 100 of 180 targets (55.6 percent) in 2022 and 103 of 175 targets (58.9 percent) in 2024. He'll likely have a higher catch rate but less target volume after joining the Rams on a two-year contract, as he's now sharing an offense with QB Matthew Stafford and WR Puka Nacua. Positive reports from June minicamp don't erase concerns about age-related decline for the 32-year-old Adams, but there's an opportunity for impressive production if he still has juice; he'll potentially playing for a good team for the first time since he was traded away from Green Bay after the 2021 campaign.

After being drafted in the seventh round, the rookie enters a crowded backfield behind D'Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson. Monangai will likely begin as the RB3 or RB4 but brings a productive college resume, including consecutive 1,200-yard seasons at Rutgers. Unless injuries occur, Monangai may be limited to special teams and spot work early in the year.

Miller missed the final two games of 2024 due to an ankle injury, but he already appears back to full health. Across 15 regular-season appearances in 2024, Miller racked up 80 tackles (53 solo), three pass breakups and one fumble, though his role declined notably after Jacksonville's bye in Week 12. He now faces competition from rookie fourth-round pick Jack Kiser for reps alongside standout linebackers Foyesade Oluokun and Devin Lloyd.

1228	598784	4239996?lang=en&region=us	15	Travis Etienne Jr.	RB	Active	Etienne said Thursday at mandatory minicamp that new head coach Liam Coen's offense "has been getting me in a lot of space" and "always puts us in position to make plays," Garry Smits of The Florida Times-Union reports.	Etienne expressed optimism the Jaguars' decision to draft guard Wyatt Milum in the third round of April's draft and sign five offensive linemen in free agency will lead to improvement up front, saying that across his Jacksonville career "we've been ranked 31, 32 in run blocking," but Coen and new general manager James Gladstone have demonstrated that they're "committed to the process and they know what it takes." Coen also dismissed trade rumors surrounding Etienne, saying that the 2021 first-round pick will be a key piece on offense and possesses all the elements necessary to succeed in the run game. Lastly, Etienne said Coen's scheme will have him running up the middle or off-tackle less -- situations he struggled in during the 2024 season -- and that "just not be[ing] predictable is going to help us a lot." Etienne's burst and vision indeed make him a good fit for Coen's scheme, but he faces plenty of competition from Tank Bigsby, plus fourth- and seventh-round rookies Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen.

1229	598766	4432773?lang=en&region=us	15	Brian Thomas Jr.	WR	Active	Thomas (shoulder) was a full practice participant Thursday, SI.com's John Shipley reports.	He returned for the final offseason practice after exiting early a day before. With the shoulder injury confirmed to minor, Thomas should be a full go for the start of training camp, where he'll look to build on a phenomenal rookie season in which he caught 87 passes for 1,282 yards and 10 TDs on 133 targets. The Jaguars have a new coaching staff, led by Liam Coen, and a new-look WR room with Travis Hunter and Dyami Brown replacing Christian Kirk (Texans) and Gabe Davis (free agent).

Murchison broke his foot during practice last October and wasn't able to return from IR, though he was designated to return ahead of the Rams' divisional-round loss to Philadelphia.

Dedich missed Los Angeles' divisional-round loss to the Eagles last season due to an illness, but he is now past the issue.

Corum suited up for all 17 regular-season games during his uneventful rookie campaign but missed both of Los Angeles' playoff bouts due to a fractured forearm suffered Week 18. The 2024 third-round pick now seems back to full health, though heading into Year 2 he faces new competition from rookie fourth-round pick Jarquez Hunter for the backup role behind Kyren Williams. As a rookie, Corum rushed just 58 times for 207 yards (3.6 YPC) while failing to reach the end zone, adding just seven catches (on eight targets) for 58 yards. Hunter boasts big-play speed that could make him a fitting complement to Williams, so Corum will need to show more this offseason to avoid being stuck in a negligible role again.

Godwin is coming back from an ankle dislocation suffered in Week 7 last season and hasn't resumed practicing. He's on the PUP list for the start of training camp, with Bowles' comments suggesting a return isn't imminent. The Bucs were confident enough in Godwin's recovery to give him $44 million guaranteed on a three-year, $66 million contract in March, but the rehab process does seem to be coming along more slowly than many expected (at least outside the organization).

Walker was placed on the active/non-football injury list Tuesday ahead of training camp with an undisclosed injury. The 29-year-old spent last season with Miami, where he recorded 68 tackles before signing with Tampa Bay in March. The Buccaneers are missing one starting inside linebacker after K.J.

Opeta is still dealing with the torn ACL suffered last August that landed him on Tampa Bay's injured reserve, forcing him to miss the entirety of the 2024 campaign.

Wirfs underwent surgery on his right knee earlier this month and is expected to miss the beginning of the regular season, Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times reports. There's a chance Wirfs will open the regular season on the reserve/PUP list, which would cost him at least the first four games of the year, but coach Todd Bowles recently told JoeBucsFan.com that Wirfs will be "ready sooner than later."

This means that Wirfs would miss at least the first four games of the season. Those games include a big division game at Atlanta on the road Week 1, a tough road game at Houston in Week 2 and a Week 4 matchup against the Eagles. With Mayfield already being a regression candidate following a career year and the departure of offensive coordinator Liam Coen, this news is a significant setback as well.

Dennis got injured Week 4 of the 2024 regular season, but he has returned to full health for Tampa Bay's offseason activities. He was among the team's most impressive defenders in OTAs and minicamp, so Dennis could push for a larger role in his third NFL season, as the 2023 fifth-round draft pick has yet to make an NFL start among his 17 regular-season appearances.

Watts landed on IR due to a knee injury ahead of Week 6 last season, and though he was designated to return in late November, he was never activated. The third-year linebacker is seemingly back to full health given his participation in OTAs and will have a chance to compete for a spot on the Bucs' 53-man roster.

Smith also noted that the Buccaneers already believed Morrison would be ready for training camp, so any participation in OTAs would be a bonus. The Notre Dame product was considered one of the best corners in the 2025 NFL Draft but fell to the second round due to injury concerns. He started all 31 games he played over his three years in college, recording 18 passes defended, including nine interceptions. Now nearing full health again, Morrison is expected to compete for one of Tampa Bay's top outside cornerback spots this summer.

Like his father Jermaine did in 1997, Williams will begin his pro football career as an undrafted free agent in Tampa Bay. He spent five seasons at LSU, accumulating 1,494 rushing yards, 600 receiving yards and 18 total touchdowns.

Greene spent five seasons as a quarterback with West Virginia, but he'll be trying to make a switch to wide receiver as a pro. Over his last two years with the Mountaineers, he rushed for 1,506 yards and 19 touchdowns, so there's no doubt he has some level of athleticism to work with. He'll have his work cut out for him in Tampa Bay, which has strong top-end talent at wideout, especially after the recent addition of Emeka Egbuka during the first round of the draft.

Coe will get his first experience as a professional in 2025 after three college seasons, one each with Cincinnati, North Carolina and California.

The three-time Pro Bowler is reportedly down 20 pounds from where he was at last season, but head coach Brian Callahan says there has been no loss of power. Coming off another successful season with 5.0 sacks and 11 tackles for loss, Simmons is expected to be the linchpin of a younger unheralded Tennessee defense.

While the Titans haven't officially declared Ward the starter, Davenport indicates that the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is firmly in line to claim the job after the team announced Monday that Will Levis, who is now on IR, will have season-ending surgery on his right shoulder next week.

Ridley had a successful opening season with the Titans, surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the third time in his career. That achievement was made more impressive by the fact that he suffered from inconsistent quarterback play from Will Levis and Mason Rudolph, something that the team hopes to have remedied with the selection of Ward. Wyatt noted that Ridley has taken to mentoring the rookie quarterback, developing rapport with him that could translate to more production come the regular season.

Mullings missed time with an injury to his abdomen immediately after being drafted in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, but he participated in minicamp and will be a full go for training camp.

1018	598839	4432708?lang=en&region=us	1	Marvin Harrison Jr.	WR	Active	Arizona's coaching staff expects Harrison to take a substantial step forward in 2025 after his uneven rookie season, Doug Haller of The Athletic reports.	Harrison has reportedly bulked up noticeably this offseason, a development that will hopefully help the No. 4 overall pick of the 2024 Draft improve in contested-catch situations in Year 2. Despite suiting up for all 17 regular-season games as a rookie and acting as the Cardinals' top wide receiver, Harrison managed just a 62-885-8 line on 116 targets, finishing as a distant second in pass-catching production compared to TE Trey McBride. QB Kyler Murray said at mandatory minicamp that he's observed improved confidence from Harrison, who will turn 23 in August. That Arizona didn't notably add to the pass-catching corps in either free agency or the 2025 Draft can only be interpreted as a vote of confidence that Harrison will indeed follow through on a notable leap this year, a development that will require him to translate his added strength and size into an ability to more consistently beat opposing cornerbacks downfield, and to do so without noticeably sacrificing speed. He'll have every opportunity to emerge as a true top wideout in 2025, at least, as Michael Wilson, Greg Dortch and Zay Jones don't represent genuine competition to the target shares of either Harrison or McBride.

1019	598768	4429275?lang=en&region=us	1	Trey Benson	RB	Active	Benson said Thursday that he added seven pounds during the offseason but feels more explosive, Darren Urban of the Cardinals' official site reports.	Benson also said he wants the Cardinals to have "two RB1s" this season, suggesting he's ready for a larger role behind James Conner after taking 69 touches for 350 total yards (on 137 snaps) during his rookie campaign. The 2024 third-round pick missed the final three games of last season with an ankle injury but came back healthy for OTAs and minicamp this spring. There aren't many running backs that offer a better combination of speed and size, with Benson having run a 4.39 40 at the 2024 Combine at 6 feet, 216 pounds. It sounds like he may have maintained that speed while pushing his weight to the 220-225 range.

The starting right tackle was placed on injured reserve on Christmas Eve last year after aggravating a right knee injury that limited him to just six games in 2024. Williams did start all six games he appeared in, and he has started all 70 games he's played in across a five-year career with the Bengals and Cardinals. Arizona signed Williams to a two-year, $30-million deal last offseason, so the team will likely try to make good on its investment this fall.

The defensive end started all three games he played in last season after signing a three-year, $30.1 million free-agent deal with the Cardinals in March 2024. Altogether, he has started 74 of the 90 games he's played in across a seven-year career with the Chargers, Bears and Cardinals. At defensive end, Arizona has Josh Sweat, who signed a four-year, $76.4 million deal with the team in March, and Darius Robinson, a 2024 first-round pick who played in only six games as a rookie due to a calf issue, but Jones should be in the mix for a leading role again.

Demercado missed the final four games of the 2024 season due to a back injury that required him to be placed on IR, but he's now back on the field for OTAs. He looked impressive as a change-of-pace option behind James Conner and Trey Benson in 2024, averaging a tremendous 9.3 YPC in a small sample size of 24 carries for 223 yards and one score (13 regular-season contests). Arizona looks set to carry an essentially identical backfield depth chart into the 2025 campaign, positioning Demercado to compete for a similar No. 3 role in which his efficiency on limited touches can shine.

Van Ginkel gets paid following a tremendous debut year with Minnesota in which he tallied 79 tackles (50 solo), including a career-high 11.5 sacks across 17 regular-season games. The 29-year-old also had six pass breakups, including two interceptions (both pick-sixes), and one forced fumble. Van Ginkel has proven big-play ability in the Vikings' defensive scheme, and he figures to remain a high-impact fantasy option in IDP formats during the 2025 campaign.

Chestnut has been with the Titans for three seasons, though he had his most extensive involvement in 2024. That came primarily via special teams, which could help him in his competition with Mullings this summer. Wyatt projects that the Titans will carry three backs on the roster with one more on the practice squad, so Chestnut could stick around even if he isn't on the active roster.

Chig Okonkwo is locked in as the Titans' top tight end, but the depth chart is uncertain thereafter. The team selected Gunnar Helm in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, who earned strong reviews during offseason workouts and is almost certainly locked into a roster spot. That sets Whyle up to battle David Martin-Robinson for third on the depth chart. Whyle took a step forward in 2024, but he's still managed only 37 receptions for 344 yards and two touchdowns across his first two seasons as a pro combined.

1478	598835	4360635?lang=en&region=us	31	Chig Okonkwo	TE	Active	Okonkwo caught the most passes of any player during Tennessee's five open practices of OTAs and mandatory minicamp, and he already appears to have developed a rapport with rookie quarterback Cam Ward, Jim Wyatt of the team's official site reports.	Okonkwo's three seasons in the league thus far have been similar, as he's now started slow, finished strong, played all 17 regular-season games and floated around the 500-yard range each year since joining the Titans in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Tennessee added TE Gunnar Helm in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, but even with more competition for snaps there's reason for optimism that improved quarterback play from Ward, the No. 1 overall pick, will pave the way for Okonkwo's production to finally take a step forward. The 6-foot-3, 238-pound tight end lacks prototypical size but boasts rare speed and YAC ability for his position. Tennessee doesn't have an entrenched No. 2 option in the passing game behind top wideout Calvin Ridley, as Tyler Lockett, Treylon Burks (ACL) and Van Jefferson plus a pair of rookie fourth-rounders in Chimere Dikeand Elic Ayomanor close out the wide receiver room. If he continues building momentum during training camp, it's not inconceivable that Okonkwo could secure that role.

Epps was placed on injured reserve early last season after tearing his ACL in Week 3. The 29-year-old had been a limited participant in the team's OTAs earlier in the offseason but looks to be progressing well.

Coen said Lawrence "feels good" and indicated that any limitations the quarterback faces at minicamp are maintenance-related, as he continues to work his way back from surgery undergone last December to address an AC joint sprain in his left, non-throwing shoulder. Lawrence reportedly looked sharp at OTAs while building chemistry with his new-look wide receiver corps, which added rookie second overall pick Travis Hunter and veteran Dyami Brown in the offseason. Hunter and Brown join budding superstar Brian Thomas, who strung together an 87-1,282-10 receiving line across 17 regular-season appearances as a rookie despite Lawrence starting just 10 of those games, replacing departed veterans Christian Kirk and TE Evan Engram.

The 2022 first-round pick out of Utah has been one of the Jaguars' top tacklers over the past three seasons, ranking second on the team with 355 total tackles across 48 regular-season contests. Lloyd has also been been a valuable asset in coverage, recording 19 passes defended, including three interceptions, since entering the league. Despite the team declining his fifth-year option, Lloyd is expected to remain one of Jacksonville's top inside linebackers in 2025, likely starting alongside Foyesade Oluokun.

Ogbah will head to Jacksonville after spending the past five seasons in Miami, where he racked up a combined 29.0 sacks. The 31-year-old could add value as a rotational pass rusher behind starters Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker during the 2025 campaign.

1238	597936	4911851?lang=en&region=us	15	LeQuint Allen Jr.	RB	Active	The Jaguars selected Allen in the seventh round of the 2025 NFL Draft, 236th overall.	The Jaguars drafted running back Bhayshul Tuten in the fourth round, so Allen enters a crowded backfield that already had Travis Etienne and Tank Bigsby. Allen declared for the NFL Draft after three years at Syracuse, two of which he served as the starter. Over those two seasons, Allen produced 2,085 rushing yards and 25 touchdowns on 473 carries (4.4 YPC) in addition to 102 receptions for 731 yards and five touchdowns. While Allen handled a hefty workload in college and started 27 straight games, his frame (6-foot, 204 pounds) and upright running style will make it difficult to maintain such a role in the NFL. Nevertheless, Allen adds versatility to the Jaguars' backfield, as he naturally catches balls and makes plays out of the backfield while also showing an ability to line up as a receiver.

Taylor notes that Royals fared well Wednesday, while running routes alongside fellow wideouts Xavier Worthy and Hollywood Brown. The report adds that the rookie fourth-rounder was often on the field when Rashee Rice wasn't, which is worth noting considering the possibility that Rice may be suspended by the NFL before the start of the regular season, a scenario that could pave the way for Royals to step into an increased role in the Chiefs offense.

Simmons is now healthy again after having suffered a torn patellar tendon while at Ohio State last season.

1242	599097	15847?lang=en&region=us	16	Travis Kelce	TE	Active	Kelce participated in Tuesday's training camp practice.	In the wake of the Chiefs' loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX, Kelce took a few weeks to ponder his playing status for the upcoming season, but on Feb. 27, the veteran tight end confirmed that he planned to return for another NFL campaign. In 16 regular-season games in 2024, Kelce put up a 97-823-3 line on 133 targets, numbers that were below the career-high marks he set in 2022 but nonetheless a pace that kept him firmly on the fantasy radar. After having dropped some weight this offseason, per The Athletic, Kelce remains entrenched as the Chiefs' top tight end and a trusted target of QB Patrick Mahomes, a context that should continue to provide the 35-year-old with a solid target share in 2025.

"We're going to progress as normal with [Rice]," said coach Andy Reid on Sunday. "He'll go in and take all the reps that he'll normally take." Rice made it back from last year's LCL tear to participate in spring practices, but things haven't been as smooth off the field, where a recent plea agreement for his hit-and-run case presumably means an NFL suspension is coming. Reid said he's aware of the possibility Rice will miss time but doesn't have any idea when the NFL might announce a suspension.

Fulton will open training camp on the sidelines due to an undisclosed injury, but he's eligible to return to practice and play at any point in the preseason.

Watson signed with the Chiefs as an undrafted free agent in April after completing his collegiate career at Texas A&amp;M in 2024, reeling in 21 catches for 280 yards and a score.

McLaurin is frustrated with negotiations but ultimately still wants an extension in Washington rather than a trade. Daniels, meanwhile, seems to be getting along fine in practice without his top wide receiver -- his first pass of 11-on-11s at training camp was a deep completion to new weapon Deebo Samuel. The Commanders also traded for LT Laremy Tunsil this offseason, and then drafted RT Josh Conerly in the first round, but their interior line figures to be temporarily weakened after standout guard Sam Cosmi suffered an ACL tear during the playoffs. It's still a good situation for Daniels overall, especially if/when McLaurin gets back on the field.

Kansas City also picked up Karlaftis' fifth-year option in April, which means he'll now be tied to the team through the 2030 campaign. This new extension also includes $62 million guaranteed, as he's been a key piece of a defense that's won two of the last three Super Bowls. The 2022 first-round pick has tallied 115 tackles, including 24.5 sacks, while appearing in 49 regular-season games over the past three seasons. Karlaftis and defensive tackle Chris Jones should continue to form one of the NFL's best pass-rushing duos in 2025.

Per Rapoport, the deal is worth $94 million, with $70 million guaranteed. Smith, who had signed his franchise tag in March, will become the highest-paid guard in the NFL. The 2021 sixth-rounder has been a starter since entering the league, and he's set to remain a key anchor on Kansas City's offensive line for the foreseeable future.

1250	598889	4683062?lang=en&region=us	16	Xavier Worthy	WR	Active	Worthy said last Thursday that he expects the Kansas City offense to provide more big plays this season, Kay Adams of FanDuel TV reports.	"Coach [Andy] Reid told us during OTAs Phase 1, 'When you come back, get your hamstrings ready,'" Worthy said last week. "So, we kind of knew that we were going to be going a little deep during practice. We kind of got our bodies and our minds ready for what we're going to be doing in practice." After leading the league with an average of 9.58 adjusted yards per attempt and 8.8 yards per attempt overall in his first season as a starter back in 2018, Patrick Mahomes has seen that number dip in five of the last six seasons, cratering all the way down to a career-worst 6.8 YPA last year. But with Worthy headed into his second season and Hollywood Brown and Rashee Rice healthy again, the offense wants to produce more big plays down the field. Worthy is an exciting mid-round fantasy pick, particularly in best-ball formats.

"I like [Thornton]," said Reid, mentioning that the wideout has "got [Mahomes'] trust" and has "gotten some valuable reps here." A 2022 second-round pick, Thornton never managed to put things together across his three seasons in New England, resulting in him being cut last November and joining Kansas City's practice squad. The 6-foot-2, 185-pound speedster has managed to flash during early offseason activities, but his next task will be to keep that momentum going during full-contact drills at training camp. The Chiefs have a crowded receiver corps, but if Thornton is able to secure a depth roster spot Reid may be able to make use of his 4.28 speed in occasional designed packages.

After suiting up in one game last year with Tennessee, Martin was waived with an undisclosed injury settlement and will now get a chance to prove himself on the Commanders. The 27-year-old caught his first career pass last season for a 49-yard touchdown. He'll face an uphill climb to make the 53-man roster given Washington already has a relatively set wide receiver corps.

Minshew appears fully recovered from the season-ending broken collarbone that limited him to 10 regular-season appearances (nine starts) with the Raiders in 2024. The veteran journeyman is secure as the No. 2 quarterback behind superstar Patrick Mahomes after signing a one-year deal with the Chiefs in March, with Bailey Zappe and Chris Oladokun battling it out for third-string duties. In the event that Minshew were to see any significant action in relief of Mahomes in 2025, his experience and the presence of pass-catchers Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown and TE Travis Kelce should allow him to pilot coach Andy Reid's offensive scheme to productive ends.

Thornton saw work with the first-team offense during the team's mandatory minicamp in mid-June. The wide receiver continued to work with starting quarterback Geno Smith and the top unit Wednesday, joining the group whenever the offense was in 11 personnel. Thornton ran an impressive 4.30-second 40-yard dash time at the 2025 NFL Scouting Combine, which makes sense considering he averaged 25.4 yards per catch as a vertical threat in his final season of collegiate action with Tennessee in 2024. The wide receiver will likely have every shot to carve out a consistent role for himself with the Raiders in 2025.

Williams was a sixth-round selection by the Broncos in the 2021 NFL Draft. He got into two games with Denver as a rookie, making one catch for 34 yards, but hasn't logged any NFL action since. Williams spent time on the practice squads of Jacksonville and Dallas over the past three years and also appeared in two regular-season and postseason games apiece for the UFL's DC Defenders this past spring, and he'll now try to make an impression with the Raiders.

Adams will reunite with his former head coach Pete Carroll, joining Las Vegas after combining to record seven total tackles (four solo) over five regular-season contests with the Titans and Lions in 2024. The safety appears to be past his prime, but some of his best years were with Carroll in Seattle, and maybe he can find a groove again with the Raiders as a depth option in the team's secondary.

Dorsett previously signed with the Raiders in March of 2023, but he was unable to break camp with the club. The veteran wideout hasn't gotten into an NFL game since that 2023 campaign, when he played in two regular-season contests with Denver and didn't catch any of his three targets. Dorsett will now have a chance to compete for a depth role in the Raiders' receiver corps, though he'll likely need to make a good impression to nab a roster spot.

Woods spent the 2024 campaign bouncing around the league with the Chargers, Eagles and Bears but didn't appear in a regular-season game.

Though Meyers can also line up outside, most of his reps during OTAs came in the slot. After recording an 87-1,027-4 receiving line on a career high 129 targets over 15 regular-season games in 2024, the sure-handed pass catcher seems poised to maintain steady volume in an offense that is now helmed by veteran QB Geno Smith, who should represent an upgrade over Gardner Minshew and Aidan O'Connell. While Meyers remains entrenched as the Raiders' WR1, it's a three-man competition between Tre Tucker, Jack Bech and Dont'e Thornton for slotting behind the 28-year-old.

1260	598956	4603186?lang=en&region=us	17	Jack Bech	WR	Active	Bech signed a four-year deal with the Raiders on Friday.	Bech, who was the 58th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, has an opportunity as a rookie to step into a key role in a Raiders wideout corps that continues to be led by Jakobi Meyers and also includes returnee Tre Tucker and 2025 fourth-rounder Dont'e Thornton. It remains to be seen what sort of volume the 6-foot-1, 214-pounder out of TCU will see out of the gate with Meyers (129 targets in 2024) and TE Brock Bowers (153 targets last season) destined to be QB Geno Smith's primary passing targets, but Bech could emerge as a lineup option in deeper formats if he's able to earn consistent playing time as the 2025 regular season progresses.

Brown was carted off the field June 11 at a minicamp practice. He was scheduled for an MRI, but the Commanders went on summer break right after and never provided any update on the nature or extent of Brown's injury.

As training camp approaches, the defensive tackle continues to bounce back from a Jones fracture that he suffered in his left foot last October, which required surgery and ended his 2024 campaign.

Ismail missed half of the 2024 season with an undisclosed injury, but it's not bothering him anymore with offseason workouts now underway.

Bennett sat out the last seven weeks of Las Vegas' 2024 season due to a shoulder issue, but he's now back in action for offseason workouts. He had become a regular starter at corner last year before getting hurt, and he'll probably play a significant role again in 2025, but he'll now have to compete for snaps with rookie third-rounder Darien Porter and FA acquisition Eric Stokes.

Chinn sat out last week's open practice, but he's now back from whatever it was that was keeping him off the field.

Koonce sustained an ACL injury prior to the beginning of Las Vegas' 2024 season, but he now appears to have moved past the issue. During the 26-year-old's last full season (2023), he tallied 43 total tackles, including 8.0 sacks, and three forced fumbles over 482 defensive snaps. Now fully healthy and playing on a one-year prove-it deal, Koonce is expected to be one of the Raiders' most effective edge rushers in 2025.

The veteran defensive lineman from Vanderbilt appeared in 17 games and played 809 defensive snaps for the Raiders in 2024, recording 65 total tackles, including 5.0 sacks, two passes defended and one forced fumble. Once Butler returns to the field, he's expected to serve as one of the team's top interior defensive lineman.

The report notes that Reagor appeared to tweak something in his lower half during Tuesday's session. With Reagor -- who Popper notes had been working consistently with the first-team offense as an outside receiver early on in training camp -- sidelined, 2025 second-rounder Tre Harris saw added first-team reps Wednesday. In the wake of Mike Williams' retirement, Harris, Derius Davis, Reagor (when available) and KeAndre Lambert-Smith are in line to compete for WR slotting behind Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston.

The running back was looking for an opportunity after missing the last two seasons with a torn ACL suffered in a jet-ski accident, and now he'll get one in an LA backfield led by Najee Harris (eye) and Omarion Hampton. The depth chart is pretty open behind those two, and Hines has the added benefit of offering potential as a kick returner, seeing as he recorded 554 kickoff-return yards and two touchdowns during the 2022 regular season. Hines has also caught at least 30 passes in all five of his pro campaigns.

Johnston handled the role for most of 2024, posting a 55-711-8 receiving line in 15 regular-season games while more than doubling his yards per route (1.85) compared to an ugly rookie campaign. It was a clear step forward for the 2023 first-round pick, but he still left some big plays on the field, dropping seven passes and struggling in contested-catch situations. The Chargers responded by signing Mike Williams -- who has since retired -- and using a second-round pick on Harris to give Johnston competition for the X receiver spot. Johnston's name is the first one Roman mentioned when discussing the position in response to Williams' recent retirement.

Molden was unavailable to open training camp while recovering from offseason knee surgery, but he has now been cleared to return to action. The safety played in 15 regular-season games with the Chargers in 2024, recording 75 total tackles (43 solo), while also adding seven passes defensed, including three interceptions, and two fumble recoveries.

Herbert's highlights Thursday included a 50-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Reagor and a sharp performance in red-zone drills. Reagor's expected to be a supporting piece in a Chargers wide receiver room that drafted rookies Tre Harris and KeAndre Lambert-Smith in the second and fifth round, respectively, while retaining Ladd McConkey, Quentin Johnston and Derius Davis. Harris is slated to sign his rookie contract with the Chargers after agreeing to terms with the team Thursday, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, but Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that Mike Williams plans to retire from the NFL rather than play out the one-year deal he signed with the Chargers in March.

Harris initially was unsigned as the Chargers' training camp opened up, but the 2025 second-rounder now is poised to rejoin his teammates at practice after reaching an agreement with the franchise on the same day that it was revealed that veteran wideout Mike Williams planned to retire. As the coming season approaches, Harris will have an opportunity to carve out a key role (that could yield lineup utility in deeper fantasy formats) in a WR corps that also features Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston, with Derius Davis, KeAndre Lambert-Smith and Jalen Reagor also on hand to compete for targets.

Per Kris Rhim of ESPN.com, Harris, who sustained an eye injury as the result of a fireworks mishap on July Fourth, isn't expected to remain on the list long, according to Chargers GM Joe Hortiz. Once the running back is ready to return to the field, he'll be able to resume practicing, but until then 2025 first-rounder Omarion Hampton figures to see added first-team reps, with Hassan Haskins, Kimani Vidal, Jaret Patterson and Raheim Sanders also currently in the team's backfield mix.

During his rookie campaign, Vidal recorded 43 carries for 155 yards and added five catches for 62 yards and a TD across 10 regular season games while working in a backfield that also included J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards. Ahead of Week 1, Vidal figures to compete with Hassan Haskins for depth slotting behind Harris and Hampton, with Schultz noting that Vidal's case for a roster spot/role in 2025 could hinge on him demonstrating that he can be a factor in the Chargers' passing game.

Pipkins hurt his oblique in Week 18 of last season and was inactive for the Chargers' wild-card loss to Houston. However, the veteran offensive lineman appears to be back to health and has been on the field with his teammates for OTAs. Pipkins started all 15 games in which he played last season but is projected to serve as a swing tackle during the coming campaign after the Chargers signed Mekhi Becton in the offseason to replace the former at right guard.

The linebacker underwent surgery after the 2024 season to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder that he had played through during the campaign.

Perryman tore at least one ligament in his left elbow during the Chargers' 2024 wild-card loss, but he now appears to have moved past the issue. The veteran from Miami was one of the Chargers' top inside linebackers in 2024, recording 55 total tackles, including 1.0 sacks, over 11 regular-season contests. Perryman signed a one-year, $3.6 deal to return to Los Angeles in March, so he's expected to remain one of the top inside linebackers in 2025.

Reports continue to suggest that Pearsall's stint on the PUP list won't be a long one. It thus seems the 49ers have bigger issues at his position, with Brandon Aiyuk coming back from an ACL tear, Demarcus Robinson in danger of a DUI-related suspension,&nbsp;and Jacob Cowing injuring his hamstring Wednesday. They also have Jauan Jennings seeking an extension, although he's opting to practice in the meantime. There are a lot of moving parts here , but Pearsall's first-round pedigree and strong finish to his rookie season give him a solid breakout case heading into Year 2.

He was the subject of glowing reports during the offseason program, only to get injured during the first practice of training camp. A 2024 fourth-round pick, Cowing got just five touches on 106 offensive snaps last season, with his main role being on punt returns (28 for 245 yards). This could've been a good chance to get some reps with Brock Purdy, as the 49ers don't have Brandon Aiyuk (knee) and Ricky Pearsall (hamstring) available for the start of camp.

The 49ers drafted Moody at No. 99 overall in 2023, making him the second kicker in 15 years to go within the top 100 picks. He mostly performed well as a rookie, but he then missed three kicks during the playoffs and made only 70.6 percent of his field-goal attempts in 2024. Moody now faces competition from Joseph, who was Minnesota's kicker from 2021 to 2023 before playing for three different teams last season. The winner of their summer battle could have volume-based fantasy value, as the 49ers have star power on offense and a seemingly favorable schedule.

Unlike position mate Brandon Aiyuk a season ago, Jennings isn't "holding in" (i.e. present but not practicing), despite recent reports that he is seeking a new contract. With Aiyuk out for the foreseeable future due to his recovery from a torn ACL and Deebo Samuel getting traded to the Commanders this offseason, Jennings is set to open the upcoming season as the 49ers' top option at wide receiver, but he currently is playing out the second season of the two-year, $15.4 million contract that he signed in May 2024. Jennings is coming off a 77-975-6 campaign on 113 targets across 15 regular-season contests, so an amended deal could be in his future.

After a 2024 season in which he missed 13 games due to Achilles tendinitis in both legs and a PCL sprain in his right knee, McCaffrey didn't have any restrictions during the offseason program and appears to be back to his normal self as camp kicks off. FB Kyle Juszczyk spoke highly of the 29-year-old McCaffrey two weekends ago at the American Century Championship in Lake Tahoe, telling Vic Tafur of The Athletic, "Christian is arguably the best player in the NFL. He was the offensive player of the year two years ago. ... He looks so healthy, he looks so explosive." McCaffrey mustered just 348 yards from scrimmage and no touchdowns on 65 touches in his four appearances last season, but in the aforementioned, award-winning 2023 campaign, he put up 2,023 total yards and 21 TDs in 16 regular-season games.

St. Brown appeared in two regular-season games with the Saints last season but wasn't targeted on 35 offensive snaps. He hasn't seen any meaningful action since 2022 with the Bears.

Mustapha is recovering from a torn ACL that he suffered in Week 17 of the 2024 season. He could miss the start of the new campaign as a result, though that hasn't been determined yet, as he can be activated from the active/PUP list at any point during the preseason. Mustapha figures to occupy a starting safety role when he is able to get back on the field.

Aiyuk is eligible to practice while on the active/PUP list, though he isn't expected to be available for training camp as he recovers from a torn ACL and MCL in his right knee sustained in October. Fellow wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (hamstring) was also placed on the active/PUP list Friday, though he's expected to have a much more optimistic recovery timeline than Aiyuk. With Jauan Jennings (calf) unhappy with his contract, there will be more opportunities for Demarcus Robinson, Jacob Cowing and Jordan Watkins during training camp.

Rourke played his final collegiate season with a torn ACL in 2024 at Indiana. The 49ers used a seventh-round pick on the quarterback, but he's not expected to practice this summer.

Robinson, who signed a two-year, $9.5 million contract in free agency with the 49ers in March, is coming off a 2024 regular season in which he recorded a 31/505/7 receiving line in 17 games with the Rams. When available, the 30-year-old is on track to provide veteran depth to a San Francisco wideout corps that could be without Brandon Aiyuk (knee) early on this season. Per Aidin Vaziri of the San Francisco Chronicle, the NFL has not announced whether Robinson will face discipline under its personal conduct policy.

There's now more clarity on Eichenberg's status after he was placed on the active/PUP list Monday with an undisclosed injury. The 27-year-old is, however, expected to be back for the start of the regular season, and in his absence, Daniel Brunskill will likely see extended usage during practice.

Burns left Wednesday's practice on crutches and will undergo further testing on his knee, but Schefter relays the Dolphins fear that the 2016 first-rounder may have torn his ACL. Burns would be sidelined for the 2025 campaign were that to be the case, which would open the door for a spot on the Dolphins' 53-man roster for Kendall Sheffield and John Saunders. Burns inked a one-year deal with Miami in March after spending the last three years in Seattle, though he appeared in just 21 regular-season games over that span.

With that in mind, McDaniel indicated that the team is simply taking a preventative and responsible approach by easing Waller into the mix. In terms of the tight end's physical readiness at the onset of training camp, McDaniel added, "this is a well-conditioned athlete who's in great shape." Once Waller re-takes the field, he'll have an opportunity to fill the void created by the trade of fellow TE Jonnu Smith (88 catches for Miami in 2024), who was traded to the Steelers last month.

Brunskill spent the past two seasons in Tennessee, playing in 31 games and making 24 starts with the Titans. He has spent most of his career playing at right guard but worked primarily as a center last year. Brunskill also has experience playing tackle, so he offers plenty of versatility to his new club.

Hill added that he's been working out hard this offseason and has something to prove coming off a disappointing 2024 season. He's reportedly trimmed down to 183 pounds, and he claims he hasn't lost any of his trademark speed. Hill is entering his age-31 season and is coming off a year in which he failed to reach 1,000 yards receiving for the first time since 2019, despite starting all 17 regular-season contests for the Dolphins. Having Tua Tagovailoa back healthy will certainly help, but Hill's yards per game dropped dramatically from 2023 (112.4) to 2024 (career-low 56.4). The plus is that there will be plenty of volume available in a concentrated Miami passing offense that lacks reliable targets beyond Hill, Jaylen Waddle, De'Von Achane and potentially Darren Waller.

Melifonwu dealt with a hamstring injury at the end of last season, but his placement on the NFI would suggest he's dealing with some sort of injury he suffered while working out away from the team. After spending the first four years of his career in Detroit, Melifonwu inked a one-year deal with the Dolphins back in March.

The trade allows Miami to shed salary while adding a standout replacement for safety Jevon Holland, who left this offseason to sign with the Giants. Fitzpatrick previously was traded in the other direction, from Miami to Pittsburgh, back in September 2019, just three weeks into his second NFL season. He ended up intercepting five passes in 14 games for the Steelers that year, earning First Team All-Pro honors for the first time (also in 2020 and 2022). Fitzpatrick had just one INT and seven pass breakups in 27 regular-season games over the past two seasons, but he's only 28 years old and should still offer some playmaking ability for Miami's secondary.

McDaniel said "when you have a rookie in the mix, you have to settle that first," referring to 2025 second-rounder Jonah Savaiinaea, who played all along the Sun Devils' O-line but appears to be settling into a guard role with the Dolphins. Daniels is rehabbing from a torn Achilles suffered in Week 4 of 2024 while with the Steelers and said he expects to be ready for the start of the regular season, but he's only been cleared to handle individual drills so far. Despite the injury, the 27-year-old signed a three-year, $24 million contract with the Dolphins in March.

Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel praised Westbrook-Ikhine, saying he's "locked in," but he also acknowledged that the free-agency signee missed time earlier this offseason due to injury, per Schad. There aren't any indications that Westbrook-Ikhine is dealing with anything that could jeopardize his availability for the start of training camp, but it's worth noting that he's missed some opportunities during early installs. Westbrook-Ikhine also acknowledged that he's still working to establish a role for himself in Miami's offense, but he expressed optimism that he'll settle in behind Tyreek Hill (wrist) and Jaylen Waddle during camp. Second-year pro Malik Washington represents his top competition for the No. 3 receiver role.

1309	598704	4682745?lang=en&region=us	20	Jaylen Wright	RB	Active	Wright has added six pounds of muscle this offseason and faces the opportunity to earn a larger backfield role Year 2, beginning with the start of mandatory minicamp Tuesday, Chris Perkins of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.	Wright entered the NFL as a 2024 fourth-round pick anticipated to join De'Von Achane as a big-play threat out of the backfield, courtesy of his 4.38 speed, but he wrapped an uneventful rookie year with just 68 carries for 249 yards (3.7 YPC) and zero touchdowns, with just one rush of 20-plus yards. Achane remains Miami's clear No. 1 tailback but is limited by a small frame and handled 281 touches in 2024, so the Dolphins should be eager for another playmaker capable of handling consistent carries to emerge. Wright still faces clear opportunity if he can impress this offseason, and coach Mike McDaniel talked up his effort during OTAs, but he'll have to compete with two larger backs in the form of experienced veteran Alexander Mattison (5-11, 220 pounds) and rookie sixth-round pick Ollie Gordon (6-1, 226 pounds), both of whom are better suited for power concepts.

Smith tore his ACL during a preseason game last August and missed the entire 2024 season. The offensive lineman is now healthy again and has "performed reasonably well" during OTAs, per Perkins.

Smith missed Miami's final five games last season after landing on IR due to a shoulder injury. The South Carolina product also began the campaign on injured reserve due to a hamstring issue, so health will be a big priority for the cornerback this year. Smith worked in a rotational role and contributed on special teams when he was able to play last season, and he figures to take on a similar role in 2025.

Murphy joined the Dolphins as an undrafted free agent last August but didn't get to see any action during the regular season, as he injured his knee in a preseason contest and missed the entire campaign. According to Perkins, Murphy tallied 3.0 sacks during practice Tuesday, so he seems to be making a good impression. Murphy will be competing for a depth role at outside linebacker during training camp.

The seventh-round pick in the 2024 draft was placed on the reserve/injured list with his undisclosed issue last July, ending his rookie season before it started.

He's in the final season of a three-year, $68 million extension, after scoring 13 TDs in the 2024 regular season and three more in the playoffs.

Miller was released by the Bills in March but made clear that he wanted to continue his playing career. A short-term deal makes sense given that he's entering his age-36 season, as does the fact that he's joining a team that has a realistic chance of reaching the postseason. The Commanders had a relative weakness at edge and pass rush entering training camp, so Miller should be a significant lift to the unit after logging 6.0 sacks across 13 regular-season games in 2024.

Selected 53rd overall last spring after a standout combine performance, Sinnott was merely Washington's No. 3 TE throughout his rookie season, catching five passes on 311 offensive snaps. He has all the raw physical tools to become a quality NFL starter, but there's no assurance the opportunity comes along this year, as the Commanders re-signed both Zach Ertz and John Bates during the offseason. It at least sounds like Sinnott is making progress in Year 2 and earning more confidence from his coaches.

Gallup also sat out Tuesday's minicamp session due to his injury. After a one-season retirement hiatus, Gallup is competing to carve out a depth role in Washington's wide receiver corps and make a comeback in the NFL. His path to a spot on the 53-man roster will become increasingly difficult the more time he misses, but Gallup at least has over a month to get healthy ahead of training camp.

Payne was unable to participate in Washington's NFC Championship Game loss to the Eagles, but he has recovered from his injuries ahead of the 2025 campaign.

1489	598543	4241474?lang=en&region=us	32	Brian Robinson Jr.	RB	Active	Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury said Robinson "has played an incredibly high level" and "knows what this year means to him and can mean to us when he plays at that level" as he enters the final season of his rookie deal, Kevin Patra of NFL.com reports.	Kingsbury called Robinson "focused" and praised his performance "early in the year" during the 2024 season "when he was really healthy." The 2022 second-round pick opened last year with a dominant share of Washington's backfield reps but picked up a knee injury Week 5, then battled ankle and hamstring issues down the stretch. While those injuries only caused Robinson to miss three regular-season games, Kingsbury's comments imply that he could have handled more opportunities had he been fully healthy. Robinson has improved in terms of rushing touchdowns and YPC in each season since entering the NFL, and with Washington's most notable offseason addition to the backfield having been 2025 seventh-rounder Jacory Croskey-Merritt, he remains positioned for the lead role alongside veteran Austin Ekeler in Kingsbury's run-heavy scheme. The Commanders upgraded the O-line via first-round pick Josh Conerly at right tackle and trade acquisition Laremy Tunsil at left tackle, putting Robinson in position to take advantage of improved blocking in an offense that should take a step forward with Jayden Daniels entering Year 2.

1491	598276	5083297?lang=en&region=us	32	Jacoby Jones	WR	Active	Jones signed with the Commanders as an undrafted free agent Friday.	Jones finished his collegiate career at UCF in 2024 after spending the previous two seasons at Ohio. His most productive college season came at Ohio in 2022, when he caught 45 passes for 777 yards and six touchdowns. After totaling just 327 receiving yards across 12 games at UCF in 2024, he's likely just an extra body for Washington's offseason activies. However, Jones could earn a spot on the practice squad if he impresses the coaching staff throughout the summer.

Gay's deal is fully guaranteed and reportedly coincides with the release of veteran incumbent Zane Gonzalez. Across 16 regular-season appearances with Indianapolis in 2024, Gay converted 31 of 37 field-goal attempts (84 percent), with all six of his misses coming from 50-plus yards out. He also converted all 33 of his extra-point tries.	Unknown	Unknown	Not Specified	Not Specified	\N	\N	2025-04-29 15:39:00	A	2025-07-24 16:02:11.990945	2025-07-24 16:02:11.990945
1493	597944	4575131?lang=en&region=us	32	Jacory Croskey-Merritt	RB	Active	The Commanders selected Croskey-Merritt in the seventh round of the 2025 NFL Draft, 245th overall.	Croskey-Merritt parlayed an impressive 2023 season at New Mexico (1,190 yards, 17 touchdowns) into a spot in Arizona's backfield in 2024. However, eligibility issues derailed his season after just one game (106 yards, one touchdown). That hurt Croskey-Merritt's ability to put one more impressive season on tape. Croskey-Merritt is older for a running back prospect (24), but his production was promising at New Mexico, and he showed to be a rugged runner there. He's a north-south type of back who won't help much in the passing game but could still push for a roster spot in Washington.

1023	598538	4360761?lang=en&region=us	1	Michael Wilson	WR	Active	Wilson (hamstring) is participating in Arizona's voluntary OTAs without any apparent restrictions, per the Cardinals' official site.	Wilson missed Arizona's season finale in 2024 due to a hamstring injury, but he suited up for the team's other 16 regular-season games and secured 47 of 71 targets for 548 yards and four touchdowns. He also rushed once for seven yards. Despite drawing 13 more targets in Year 2, Wilson finished with a relatively similar receiving line to the 38 grabs for 565 yards and three scores he compiled as a rookie, due in large part to his yards per catch dropping from 14.9 to 11.7. With the Cardinals having opted against adding significant competition to the pass-catching corps this offseason, Wilson is positioned to reprise a starting role and operate as Kyler Murray's third-look target behind No. 1 wideout Marvin Harrison and tight end Trey McBride.

Prior to hurting his right knee Week 16 of last season, Conner had racked up six 100-yard rushing efforts through 15 games, and while he attempted to gut through it Week 17, he managed just six touches before departing early and then was placed on IR before Week 18. Overall, he handled 236 carries and hauled in 47 of 55 targets en route to a career-best 1,518 yards from scrimmage along with nine total touchdowns in 16 regular-season contests. More than five months removed the aforementioned injury, Conner is healthy, stating, "I'm ready," as Arizona kicks off on-field work this spring.

It's still not fully clear what happened, but the update sheds some light on the circumstances surrounding the unusual development for Murphy-Bunting. He'll now have to begin rehabbing from the procedure, and in the meantime, his absence will force Arizona to lean more heavily on 2025 second-rounder Will Johnson and 2024 second-rounder Max Melton.

The Memphis product spent the first three years of his career with the Buccaneers but has now found a new home in Arizona. Russell appeared in 16 regular-season games for Tampa Bay in 2024, tallying 33 total tackles and one pass defended across 568 total snaps (236 defensive and 332 on special teams). With the Cardinals, the 26-year-old is expected to compete for a depth spot in the team's linebacker corps.

A 2020 third-round pick of the Packers who spent 2024 with the Jaguars, Deguara has 50 career catches for 450 yards and two touchdowns, including three catches for 14 yards a year ago. He has played on over 800 special-teams snaps over the course of his career, and he could earn a role that way on the Cardinals. Arizona's tight end room is led by Trey McBride, who caught 111 passes for 1,146 yards in 2024, and then Tip Reiman and Elijah Higgins.

Green spent the first two years of his college career at Oklahoma State before transferring to Wisconsin ahead of the 2023 season. During his two years at Wisconsin, the 6-foot-2 receiver caught 49 passes for 599 yards and four touchdowns across 19 games. Though Green is likely just an extra body for offseason activities, he could earn a depth spot in the Cardinals' wide receiver corps if he impresses this summer.

The 2021 second-round pick never panned out as a starting wide receiver, but he'll try to continue his career as a return specialist and depth wideout after a non-contact knee injury last summer cost him the entire 2024 campaign. The Vikings return starting wideouts Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and Jalen Nailor, with rookie third-round pick Tai Felton giving the team a fourth roster lock at the position. That likely leaves two spots up for grabs, with special teams potentially a big factor in determining them.

Head coach Kevin O'Connell announced that Fries is cleared to ready and go ahead of the start of training camp after he suffered a broken tibia in Week 5 of last season with the Colts.

1054	598954	4684527?lang=en&region=us	3	T.J. Sanders	DT	Active	Sanders signed his rookie contract with the Bills on Friday.	That gets all the Bills' rookies signed before training camp starts up for the team that has won five straight AFC East titles. As for Sanders, he's got major athleticism coming out of South Carolina, but the Bills run deep at defensive line and already have starters Ed Oliver and DaQuan Jones to cover the middle. Therefore, Sanders is probably slotted as more of a key rotational player for his rookie campaign.

Corbin spent time with the Giants last offseason but was waived/injured ahead of Week 1. He then resurfaced with the San Antonio Brahmas and led the UFL in rushing yards during the 2025 season. His only NFL action came in 2023, when he handled primarily a special-teams role for the Giants in six regular-season games. The Falcons waived Jase McClellan (knee) in a corresponding move.

The safety appears to be healthy again after getting waived from injured reserve with an injury settlement by the Falcons last September, though his injury remained undisclosed.

Dorlus was inactive for Atlanta's 2024 season finale due to an abdomen injury, but his participation OTAs suggest he's moved past the issue. The second-year pro from Oregon appeared in just two games during his rookie campaign, recording three total tackles over 25 total snaps (19 defensive and six on special teams). Dorlus is likely to compete for a depth role on the Falcons' defensive line as the summer progresses.

Koo was back out on the practice field after missing the Falcons' last three contests of 2024 with a right hip injury. The veteran kicker made 25 of 34 field-goal attempts while making all 26 of his extra-point tries over 14 games last year.

Mooney is coming off a 2024 campaign with Atlanta in which he caught 64 of 106 targets for 992 yards and five touchdowns over 16 contests. The wide receiver missed the team's regular-season finale with a shoulder injury, but he appears to be fully healthy ahead of 2025.

Trice suffered an ACL tear during Atlanta's 2024 preseason opener back in August, and it's encouraging that he's active at OTAs, albeit not at full capacity. Once he's back in the mix, the 2024 third-round pick could have trouble winning significant snaps in a Falcons pass rush that added Jalon Walker and James Pearce in the first round of the 2025 Draft after signing Leonard Floyd in free agency.

Spector dealt with a calf injury for the entire 2024 season, which caused him to miss nine games (including the Bills' three playoff games). He looks to be fully healthy for the start of training camp, and Glab relays that the 2022 seventh-rounder made a strong impression during Wednesday's practice.

"We'll have a rep plan for [Bosa] and a way to manage things to the best of our ability to try and keep him as healthy as possible," McDermott relayed to reporters before Wednesday's practice. Bosa has missed 23 regular-season games since 2022 and hasn't played more than 54 percent of snaps in a season since 2021 due to injury.

1053	599074	5089537?lang=en&region=us	3	David White Jr.	WR	Active	The Bills signed White on Tuesday.	The 25-year-old wide receiver spent last offseason with Jacksonville but tore his ACL during minicamp and missed the 2024 campaign. He's yet to appear in a regular-season contest and should be viewed as a longshot to make Buffalo's 53-man roster.

Skinner's a long shot to make the team out of training camp, but the wide receiver out of Vanderbilt will try to impress the coaching staff and climb the depth chart. He had 367 receiving yards and three touchdowns in 2024, which was the 6-foot-1, 204-pounder's most productive college campaign.

1055	598794	4385690?lang=en&region=us	3	Dalton Kincaid	TE	Active	Kincaid has "added both strength and bulk" during the offseason, Joe Buscaglia of The Athletic reports.	Kincaid dealt with knee injuries last year, causing him to miss three regular-season games and to log lower snap counts following his Week 15 return. Bills GM Brandon Beane attributed the talented tight end's lessened statistics -- he went from a 73-673-2 receiving line in the regular season as a rookie to a 44-448-2 line as a sophomore -- to  the knee issues, saying Kincaid's campaign was "really more of an injury thing and nothing more than that." Per Buscaglia, Kincaid impressed during practice Thursday and now has a clean bill of health. He adds that Kincaid's increased strength could help him remain on the field more often for run-blocking reps, which would increase his offensive snap count and be a boost to Buffalo's offense.

1056	598792	4688931?lang=en&region=us	3	Maxwell Hairston	CB	Questionable	Hairston (hamstring) signed his rookie contract Friday.	The Bills have big plans for the speedy rookie, as he's lined up for a starting cornerback role right out of the gate after being selected 30th overall in April, assuming the pulled hamstring he suffered this week during minicamp is nothing major. Hairston's Kentucky teammate Deone Walker also signed his rookie deal Friday.

1057	598789	4635008?lang=en&region=us	3	Keon Coleman	WR	Active	Coleman was up-and-down during mandatory minicamp, showing some quality routes and a connection with Josh Allen during 7-on-7 and 11-on-11 drills, but he also struggled with occasional drops and mental mistakes, Joe Buscaglia of The Athletic reports.	Coleman's biggest mistake of minicamp came Wednesday, when he deflected a ball that was well out of his reach just enough to result in an incompletion to Khalil Shakir, Allen's intended target. As a rookie, Coleman was also inconsistent, finishing with 29 catches for 556 yards and four touchdowns (on 57 targets) across 13 regular-season appearances while mostly being cast as a deep threat. Buffalo was encouraged enough by Coleman in Year 1 that the team didn't make it a priority to add to the pass-catching group this offseason, though the team did ink another field-stretcher in Joshua Palmer. As Buscaglia notes, Coleman still has tremendous opportunity before him, and his development will likely be the primary deciding factor in how strongly the Bills pursue additional pass catchers during the 2026 offseason.

Thompson sat out the majority of the 2024 season after tearing his Achilles, but that didn't deter Buffalo from bringing him aboard on a short-term deal. He has played in just six games over the past two years combined, and he just turned 31 in April, but he could still play a significant role on the Bills' defense in 2025 if he can manage to remain available.

Andersen was placed on injured reserve back in Week 16 of last season due to a knee injury, and it appears as if the 26-year-old is still dealing with lingering effects. The fourth-year pro can return to practice at any point during the preseason, but Andersen might be on the outside looking in as the team's preferred starter after the Falcons signed Divine Deablo this offseason.

Pitts was present for Atlanta's offseason program but didn't practice, with reports suggesting a foot injury was responsible for his lack of activity. It sounds like he'll have plenty of time to ramp up for Week 1 as he prepares for the fifth and final season of his rookie contract, subject to the lowest expectations of his career after failing to break out (again) in 2024 under a new coaching staff.

Orlando Ledbetter of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.	Robinson averaged an impressive 4.8 yards per carry last season, but he produced just one run of longer than 30 yards. According to Ledbetter, 31 players had multiple runs of 30-plus yards last season, and seven different players had five or more. Robinson had just 12 of his 304 carries produce 15-plus yards, as he was one of the running backs least reliant on big plays. He wants to change that heading into his third season. Robinson is a consensus top-five fantasy pick ahead of training camps.	Unknown	Unknown	Not Specified	Not Specified	\N	\N	2025-07-22 20:01:00	A	2025-07-24 15:58:07.42707	2025-07-24 15:58:23.757078
1032	599070	4360423?lang=en&region=us	2	Michael Penix Jr.	QB	Active	Penix heads into training camp as Atlanta's undisputed starting quarterback, D. Orlando Ledbetter of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.	Kirk Cousins presumably still wants to be traded, but that didn't stop him from attending spring practices and likely won't keep him out of training camp. The veteran is taking second-team reps now, after the Falcons averaged 32 points per game in Penix's three starts at the end of last season. Bijan Robinson scored two TDs in each of the three games, and Drake London had 352 yards and two TDs on 39 targets. Apart from the QB change and Ryan Neuzil replacing Drew Dalman at center, Atlanta's starting offense looks much the same as it did last summer. All of the team's projected 2025 starters were in Atlanta last offseason when offensive coordinator Zac Robinson installed his scheme.

1034	598689	14880?lang=en&region=us	2	Kirk Cousins	QB	Active	Cousins is slated to attend the Falcons' mandatory minicamp Tuesday and Wednesday. Dianna Russini of The Athletic reports.	Cousins attended Atlanta's voluntary workouts in April but not voluntary OTAs in late May and early June. The veteran quarterback has expressed his desire to be traded to a team where he could compete to start, rather than work as the backup to Michael Penix. The Browns, Steelers and Vikings had been named as potential suitors for Cousins this offseason, but Cleveland has since added rookie draft picks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, while Pittsburgh's long-awaited one-year deal with Aaron Rodgers finally has materialized. Cousins is now heading into his age-37 season, carrying a cumbersome contract and fresh off a 2024 campaign in which he visibly petered out down the stretch before being benched. Unless a path to a starting gig elsewhere and trade somehow comes to pass, for fantasy purposes Cousins looks like a mere late-round stash in formats that start multiple QBs.

1042	598153	4426502?lang=en&region=us	2	Drake London	WR	Active	The Falcons are exercising their fifth-year option on London's rookie contract, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.	The eighth overall pick from the 2022 Draft is now under contract through 2026, although it may not be long before he signs an extension that locks him in beyond that. London had career highs in every major counting stat last year, including 41 more targets (158) and 366 more yards (1,271) than his previous personal bests. He had just three 100-yard performances, but two of those came in the final two games after Michael Penix took over as Atlanta's starting QB. There should be plenty of volume for London again in 2025, after the Falcons focused on their defense this offseason and failed to acquire any significant competition for targets or carries.

Horn suffered a hamstring injury during OTAs in June, but he looks to be past the issue. He spent a good portion of Wednesday's practice fielding punts, and the rookie sixth-rounder would carve a spot for himself on the 53-man roster were he to win that job.

Tremble is on the active/PUP list for the start of training camp, and it sounds like he may remain there until mid-August or so, which puts his Week 1 availability into question. He had a procedure on his back in May, two months after re-signing with the Panthers on a two-year contract. Tremble is mostly known for his blocking, with 85 career catches in 61 games, while 2024 fourth-round pick Ja'Tavion Sanders is the favorite to be Carolina's top pass-catching TE.

Mabry spent the previous five campaigns in Seattle's organization and got into 12 regular-season games, catching his lone target for a seven-yard touchdown in 2022. He'll get a chance to compete for a depth role in the Panthers' tight-end corps, though he'll likely need to make a strong impression to make the season-opening roster.

Brown said in April that he'd be ready for the start of the regular season, per David Newton of ESPN.com. The defensive end only played in one game in 2024 due to a meniscus issue, but in 2023 he recorded 103 tackles (57 solo), including 2.0 sacks, and six pass breakups, including an interception. The 2020 first-round pick started 63 of 66 regular-season games across his first four seasons, and then he earned a four-year, $96-million extension ahead of the 2024 campaign.

Panthers coach Dave Canales said McMillan took a hit to the leg Tuesday while accidentally colliding with a defensive back, per Joe Person of The Athletic, causing the rookie first-round pick to be held out of the final two days of mandator minicamp. All signs are that McMillan's absence from on-field work is purely precautionary, but the next chance to see him at team practices won't come until training camp in July. A minor injury at this stage of the summer doesn't move the needle in terms of projecting McMillan's production Year 1, so if an abundance of caution causes his ADP to slide in early fantasy drafts it could be an opportunity to pounce.

Kaye notes that Coker "looked fast" and seems to have recovered from the soft-tissue injury that limited his participation in OTAs.

Wonnum sat out Carolina's last two open workouts entirely, so Tuesday's action is a sign of progress in his recovery from a lingering back issue.

Despite initially being surprised by the Bears' selection of Colston Loveland, Kmet has bought into coach Ben Johnson's plan to use both tight ends. Johnson ran the NFL's third-most plays out of 12 personnel last year, and Kmet is expected to be on the field frequently in those sets. His role as a core piece in two-TE packages should provide limited fantasy viability, as target volume likely remains capped with Loveland expected to be the primary pass catcher.

Odunze's expectations for 2025 would be an enormous step forward from the 54-734-3 receiving line he tallied on 101 targets across 17 regular-season appearances as a rookie, but enough went wrong for Chicago in 2024 that a true evaluation of last year's No. 9 overall pick is difficult to make. Unreliable pass protection, inconsistency from Caleb Williams and coaching so poor that the Bears deployed three different offensive coordinators all stood in the way of Odunze's production, but the team has since upgraded to head coach Ben Johnson, previously the Lions' mastermind OC, and added three new starters along the interior O-line, including All-Pro LG Joe Thuney. While the departure of Keenan Allen still leaves Odunze with significant target competition from DJ Moore, first-round rookie TE Colston Loveland (shoulder) and second-round rookie WR Luther Burden (undisclosed), overall, fantasy managers couldn't have asked for better offseason developments as the talented wideout targets a significant step forward.

Brisker missed a total of 12 contests last season due to concussion issues, but he appears to be back to full health, as Bair noted Brisker was flying around and "talking serious trash" at Wednesday's practice.

The first season of Swift's three-year, $24 million deal with the Bears disappointed compared to expectations, as he finished with just 959 rushing yards and six touchdowns despite playing all 17 regular-season games and handling a career-high 253 carries. He averaged just 3.8 YPC in 2024 after having combined for 4.6 YPC across the first four years of his NFL career. As such, it was somewhat surprising to see Chicago fail to add notable backfield competition in free agency or the 2025 NFL Draft. Rookie seventh-round pick Kyle Monangai joins Roschon Johnson as a depth option, but Swift seems destined to reprise a starting role. With the benefit of a much-improved O-line and Johnson's promising offensive scheme, Swift will be in tremendous position to improve upon his 2024 stats if he sees a similar amount of opportunities. Johnson, who was Swift's offensive coordinator during his final season in Detroit in 2022, called the running back a "fierce competitor" and praised his willingness to "find a way to put his shoulder down and move the pile."

Hendrickson did not report for the start of training camp Tuesday as he seeks a contract extension after recording 35.0 sacks over the past two seasons. He missed most of OTAs and all of minicamp in June while talks broke down with the Bengals, and the two sides continue to face an impasse as training camp gets underway.

1105	599222	4426422?lang=en&region=us	7	Dax Hill	CB	Questionable	Hill (knee) has been cleared to participate in individual drills, Chris Roling of USA Today reports.	Hill's 2024 season was cut short in early October after he tore the ACL in his right knee against the Ravens in Week 5. Per Geoff Hobson of the Bengals' official site, Hill relayed Monday that he'll be "eased in" to training camp and is aiming to be fully healthy for Week 1 against the Browns on Sept. 7.

1106	599182	3915511?lang=en&region=us	7	Joe Burrow	QB	Active	Head coach Zac Taylor noted Wednesday that he anticipates playing Burrow more in preseason games "than we ever have" as the Bengals prepare for the 2025 regular season, Ben Baby of ESPN.com reports.	With that in mind, Burrow's next chance to see game action will occur Aug. 7, when the Bengals face the Eagles in the first of their three scheduled exhibition contests. On the heels of a 2024 campaign in which he logged 4,918 passing yards and a 43:9 TD:INT in 17 regular-season tilts, Burrow should benefit from the fact that pass-catching mainstays Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Mike Gesicki all inked multi-year extensions with Cincinnati this offseason.

1107	599106	4035676?lang=en&region=us	7	Zack Moss	RB	Out	The Bengals placed Moss (neck) on the active/non-football injury list Tuesday.	Moss was able to take the field during the Bengals' OTAs, but as Ben Baby of ESPN.com notes, the running back is bouncing back from a season-ending neck injury. Once he's ready to resume practice, Moss can be activated from the NFL list, but for now Samaje Perine, Tahj Brooks, Gary Brightwell, Kendall Milton and Quali Conley are available to compete for slotting behind top back Chase Brown.

Hill	DT	Questionable	Hill (foot) will be limited to start camp for precautionary reasons, coach Zac Taylor said Monday, Kelsey Conway of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports.	Hill had a walking boot on for voluntary workouts in May. He seems to have progressed in his recovery since then, but the Bengals have little reason to rush the veteran defensive tackle's return with the regular season over a month away.

1109	599013	3115249?lang=en&region=us	7	Taven Bryan	DT	Active	Bryan signed a one-year deal with the Bengals on Sunday, Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reports.	Bryan spent the last two seasons playing as a rotational piece on the Colts' defensive line, totaling 42 tackles and 3.0 sacks while appearing in all 34 regular-season games over that span. The 29-year-old was a first-round pick for the Jaguars in 2018, and he's never played fewer than 15 regular-season games in his career. Bryan will add some veteran depth behind presumptive starting defensive tackles B.J. Hill (foot) and Tedarrell Slaton.

1110	599008	4239086?lang=en&region=us	7	Desmond Ridder	QB	Active	Ridder signed a contract with the Bengals on Sunday, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports.	Ridder heads back to the city where he played college football in Cincinnati, as he'll join his third team in the last 16 months since being traded from the Falcons to the Cardinals in March 2024. The 2022 third-round pick ultimately spent the 2024 season with the Raiders and served as the third option behind Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew. Ridder completed 61 percent of 85 passes while appearing in six games with one start in Las Vegas. In his lone start, he went 23-for-39 passing for 208 yards and one touchdown to two interceptions during a 15-9 loss to Atlanta, which is also the team he started 13 games for in 2023. Ridder will now provide competition for the Bengals' backup quarterback job behind Joe Burrow. Cincinnati's No. 2 quarterback over the past two seasons has been Jake Browning, who started seven games when Burrow was injured in 2023.

With Addison's court case now complete, the NFL likely will weigh in soon on a possible suspension. Even though he pleaded to a lesser charge, he still could face discipline since the NFL's substance-abuse policy has a baseline punishment for a first-time DUI offense of a three-game suspension.

McCarthy	QB	Active	McCarthy has been participating in spring practices without any issues in his surgically repaired knee, Ben Goessling of The Minnesota Star Tribune reports.	Coming back from a meniscus tear suffered last summer, McCarthy resumed on-field work in January, setting him up for a normal offseason. As expected, he had no limitations during OTAs and then passed his physical at the start of June minicamp. With Sam Howell and Brett Rypien being the veteran quarterbacks on Minnesota's roster, McCarthy doesn't appear to have any competition for the Week 1 starting job. He's in a great situation under coach Kevin O'Connell, throwing passes to Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson while playing behind one of the best offensive lines in the league. McCarthy also offers more running ability that Sam Darnold, who threw for a career-high 4,319 yards and 35 TDs in Minnesota during the 2024 regular season.

This marks the first time that Darrisaw has been on the field since tearing both his ACL and MCL last September.

1321	598724	3916749?lang=en&region=us	21	Giovanni Ricci	TE	Active	Minnesota signed Ricci on Tuesday.	In a corresponding transaction, the Vikings released linebacker Matt Harmon. Ricci was dropped by Cleveland last August before signing a futures deal with New England in February, and he's now changing uniforms again. He's unlikely to crack Minnesota's 53-man roster in 2025.

1322	598712	4382466?lang=en&region=us	21	Jalen Nailor	WR	Active	Nailor has bulked up and gained muscle in the offseason, Judd Zulgand of SKOR North reports.	Nailor will face increased competition for the third receiver role, with the Vikings drafting Tai Felton in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft and signing free agent Rondale Moore. Whoever wins the role could see an increase in playing time if Jordan Addison misses time due to a possible suspension from his DUI arrest last summer. While gaining muscle may not mean much in terms of improving his chances to win the role, it shows he's doing work in the offseason.

Oliver is one of the league's better run-blocking tight ends and he filled in capably as a pass-catcher at times in 2024 for T.J. Hockenson, who didn't make his debut until Week 9. With Hockenson now fully recovered from the ACL tear he sustained in 2023, Oliver remains positioned to handle a familiar blocking role integral Minnesota's overall offense, but not in a way that translates to notable fantasy value.

1326	598581	4360569?lang=en&region=us	21	Jordan Mason	RB	Active	Mason (ankle) participated in on-field drills during OTAs on Tuesday, per the Vikings' official site.	Mason appears fully recovered from the high-ankle sprain that forced him to miss the final five regular-season games of his breakout 2024 campaign in San Francisco. The 26-year-old impressed out of the gate last year with Christian McCaffrey unavailable for the 49ers, rushing 134 times for 685 yards (5.1 YPC) and three scores during the team's first eight games, before injuries of his own popped up. Aaron Jones inked a two-year extension with Minnesota this offseason and still projects as the team's starter, but in the interest of keeping the 30-year-old fresh, Mason will be a candidate to push for a significant backfield split. Boasting a far larger frame at 5-foot-11, 223 pounds, Mason also seems the favorite for short-yardage and goal-line work.

Davis will now be able to participate in practices and preseason games after passing his physical. The veteran corner signed a three-year, $60 million contract with the Patriots in March after spending the 2024 season with the Lions, when he recorded 56 tackles (42 solo), 11 pass defenses (including two interceptions), one forced fumble and two fumble recoveries across 13 regular-season games. Davis is expected to start at outside corner opposite 2023 first-rounder Christian Gonzalez.

Though Polk didn't land on either the PUP or non-football injury list, the 2024 second-rounder is bouncing back from an offseason shoulder procedure that limited him during spring workouts. Following a disappointing rookie season in which he caught just 12 passes in 15 games, the sooner Polk is able to practice, the better, given that the Washington product faces plenty of competition for slotting in a crowded WR corps.

1335	599197	4429022?lang=en&region=us	22	Kayshon Boutte	WR	Active	Boutte, Stefon Diggs and DeMario Douglas opened training camp Wednesday as New England's first-team wide receivers, Mike Kadlick of CLNSMedia.com reports.	Diggs is locked in for one starting job -- assuming his return from an ACL tear continues to go swimmingly -- and Douglas figures to be the slot man again. That leaves Boutte to compete with rookie third-round Kyle Williams and others for one starting job, with Boutte hoping to build on his strong finish to 2024. He had 240 yards and two TDs over the final three weeks of last season after recording 336 yards and one TD across 10 previous starts. Bourne has a chance to defend his starting job, but there's also risk of dropping off the roster if he struggles this summer, as Diggs, Douglas and Williams are locks to make it, leaving only 2-to-3 spots up for grabs between Boutte, Kendrick Bourne, Mack Hollins (undisclosed), Ja'Lynn Polk (shoulder), Javon Baker, Efton Chism and others.

It remains to be seen if Diggs will have limitations once the Patriots ramp up the intensity of practices and do contact work. For now, he seems to be ahead of the typical timeline for his injury, avoiding the PUP list at the start of training camp less than nine months after suffering an ACL tear. Diggs' participation in the first camp practice puts him on track to play Week 1 for his new team.

Minkins signed with the Patriots as an undrafted free agent following April's NFL Draft. He has a narrow path to a roster spot, so it will be important for Minkins to come off the NFI list as soon as possible in order to be able to begin practicing and playing in preseason games.

It's not clear what type of issue Lowe is dealing with, but this move isn't necessarily an indication that he won't be ready for the start of the campaign, as players placed on the PUP list during the preseason can begin practicing and participating in games as soon as they are medically cleared.

Hooper is among a group of four Patriots who were moved to the PUP list Saturday. Players on the list are eligible to return to practice and participate in preseason games as soon as they are medically cleared.

It's not clear what type of injury Hollins is dealing with, but he won't be practicing to begin camp. However, he's eligible to come off the PUP list and begin practicing as soon as he's medically cleared. Hollins signed a two-year deal with New England in March and is expected to compete for targets with the likes of DeMario Douglas, Kayshon Boutte and Kendrick Bourne, when healthy.

1341	598960	4360294?lang=en&region=us	22	Antonio Gibson	RB	Active	As the coming season approaches, Gibson and fellow returnee Rhamondre Stevenson will have added competition for backfield touches, with rookie second-rounder TreVeyon Henderson now in the mix, Evan Lazar of the Patriots' official site reports.	In his first season with the Patriots, Gibson worked behind Stevenson, carrying 120 times for 538 yards and a TD, while adding 23 catches for 206 yards in 17 regular-season contests. Looking ahead, Stevenson -- who logged 207 carries in 15 regular-season games in 2024 -- is back to reclaim his share of the team's early-down work, with the presence of the explosive Henderson likely to cut into Gibson's volume. In that context, the 27-year-old is largely off the re-draft radar, but that's something that could change if either Stevenson or Henderson were to miss time at some point.

When healthy, free agent addition Stefon Diggs (knee) is projected to emerge as the team's WR1, with Douglas set to reprise his slot role in the offense. Meanwhile, rookie third-rounder Kyle Williams and newcomer Mack Hollins are also likely see their share of snaps in 2025, with Kendrick Bourne, Kayshon Boutte, Ja'Lynn Polk, Javon Baker and Efton Chism also in the mix for depth chart slotting. On the heels of a 2024 regular season in which he recorded 66 catches on 87 targets for 621 yards and three TDs in 17 games, Douglas should maintain enough volume in his third pro campaign to merit lineup consideration in deeper PPR formats, in particular if Drake Maye continues to make strides in his second year as New England's franchise QB.

1343	598902	3045523?lang=en&region=us	22	Kendrick Bourne	WR	Active	As the coming season approaches, Bourne is in line to compete for a spot in the Patriots' revamped wide receiver corps, Evan Lazar of the team's official site reports.	When healthy, Stefon Diggs (knee) profiles as the team's top wideout, while DeMario Douglas and 2025 third-rounder Kyle Williams also seem like roster locks. Mack Hollins is likely to secure a role as well. With that in mind, Bourne -- who carries a $7.7 million cap hit this season -- figures to compete for depth chart slotting with Kayshon Boutte, Ja'Lynn Polk, Javon Baker and Efton Chism. Working in Bourne's favor is his experience in offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels' scheme, who was on hand when the 29-year-old logged a career-high 925 yards from scrimmage in 2021, but for now Bourne doesn't have a path to steady targets in a crowded WR room.
